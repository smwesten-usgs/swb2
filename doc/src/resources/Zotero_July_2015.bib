This paper is a review of physically-based rainfall interception modelling. Fifteen models were selected, representing distinct concepts of the interception process. Applications of these models to field data sets published before March 2008 are also analysed. We review the theoretical basis of the different models, and give an overview of the models’ characteristics. The review is designed to help with the decision on which model to apply to a specific data set. The most commonly applied models were found to be the original and sparse Gash models (69 cases) and the original and sparse Rutter models (42 cases). The remaining 11 models have received much less attention, but the contribution of the Mulder model should also be acknowledged. The review reveals the need for more modelling of deciduous forest, for progressively more sparse forest and for forest in regions with intensive storms and the consequent high rainfall rates. The present review also highlights drawbacks of previous model applications. Failure to validate models, the few comparative studies, and lack of consideration given to uncertainties in measurements and parameters are the most outstanding drawbacks. Finally, the uncertainties in model input data are rarely taken into account in rainfall interception modelling.},

	series = {Scientific Investigations Report},
	abstract = {This report documents the computer program {INFIL}3.0, which is a grid-based, distributed-parameter, deterministic water-balance watershed model that calculates the temporal and spatial distribution of daily net infiltration of water across the lower boundary of the root zone. The bottom of the root zone is the estimated maximum depth below ground surface affected by evapotranspiration. In many field applications, net infiltration below the bottom of the root zone can be assumed to equal net recharge to an underlying water-table aquifer. The daily water balance simulated by {INFIL}3.0 includes precipitation as either rain or snow; snowfall accumulation, sublimation, and snowmelt; infiltration into the root zone; evapotranspiration from the root zone; drainage and water-content redistribution within the root-zone profile; surface-water runoff from, and run-on to, adjacent grid cells; and net infiltration across the bottom of the root zone.

The water-balance model uses daily climate records of precipitation and air temperature and a spatially distributed representation of drainage-basin characteristics defined by topography, geology, soils, and vegetation to simulate daily net infiltration at all locations, including stream channels with intermittent streamflow in response to runoff from rain and snowmelt. The model does not simulate streamflow originating as ground-water discharge. Drainage-basin characteristics are represented in the model by a set of spatially distributed input variables uniquely assigned to each grid cell of a model grid.

The report provides a description of the conceptual model of net infiltration on which the {INFIL}3.0 computer code is based and a detailed discussion of the methods by which {INFIL}3.0 simulates the net-infiltration process. The report also includes instructions for preparing input files necessary for an {INFIL}3.0 simulation, a description of the output files that are created as part of an {INFIL}3.0 simulation, and a sample problem that illustrates application of the code to a field setting. Brief descriptions of the main program routine and of each of the modules and subroutines of the {INFIL}3.0 code, as well as definitions of the variables used in each subroutine, are provided in an appendix.},

@thesis{arrington_mapping_2009,
	title = {Mapping infiltration rates in Dane County, Wisconsin},
	abstract = {Dane County, Wisconsin has experienced rapid population growth and development over the last 40 years. Groundwater pumping and loss of recharge associated with development have contributed to significant groundwater drawdown- up to 20m compared to predevelopment conditions. Infiltrating stormwater is a practice that may minimize recharge loss in developed areas, especially if the stormwater is directed to high-infiltration soils. The saturated hydraulic conductivity (K sat ), which is a measure of how easily a soil transmits water, can be used to compare the infiltration potential of different soils. Most Ksat estimates are based on measurements in which water flow is primarily through micropores, rather than macropores. However, macropore flow can dominate the infiltration rate when the soil is saturated, as it is likely to be in areas receiving stormwater runoff.

The objective of this study was to produce a relative infiltration map for Dane. County that is based on local infiltration measurements that do include macropore flow. Infiltration measurements were taken (50 sites, 124 measurements) and soil samples collected for a wide variety of soils and land uses across Dane County. Multiple regression analysis was done to examine relationships between K sat and soil and non-soil properties (landcover and topography). Percent sand and bulk density of the surface horizon were the two best soil property predictors of Ksat . Landcover was the best non-soil Ksat predictor. These relationships were used to develop a relative infiltration map for Dane County from existing geospatial data layers for soils, landcover and topography. Including landcover as a predictor of Ksat improves the accuracy of the regression model compared to the model based on soil properties alone (percent sand and bulk density) and also increases the spatial resolution of the relative infiltration map. This map is designed for use in township or watershed-scale land use planning. Local land use planners can use this information to identify the suitability of potential development areas for infiltration-based stormwater management.},

The {SCS}-{CN} is a simple and valuable approach to quantify the total streamflow volume generated by storm rainfall, but its use is not appropriate for estimating the sub-daily incremental rainfall excess. To overcome this drawback, we propose to include the Green-Ampt ({GA}) infiltration model into a mixed procedure, which is referred to as Curve Number for Green-Ampt ({CN}4GA), aiming to distribute in time the information provided by the {SCS}-{CN} method. For a given storm, the computed {SCS}-{CN} total net rainfall amount is employed to calibrate the soil hydraulic conductivity parameter of the {GA} model. The proposed procedure is evaluated by analysing 100 rainfall–runoff events that were observed in four small catchments of varying size. {CN}4GA appears to provide encouraging results for predicting the net rainfall peak and duration values and has shown, at least for the test cases considered in this study, better agreement with the observed hydrographs than the classic {SCS}-{CN} method.

	abstract = {Vegetation develops in response to many different stimuli including climatic, edaphic, and cultural conditions. The degree to which the distribution of vegetation can be explained on the basis of climatic conditions depends in part on the proper selection of active climatic factors. Temperature and precipitation by themselves are poor descriptors of climate. Potential evapotranspiration, water surplus, and water deficit (combined in a moisture index) are found to be more useful. An analysis of the vegetation distribution in conterminous United States shows that the Thornthwaite moisture index and annual potential evapotranspiration are not only able to differentiate among the mid-latitude grassland, forest, and desert biochores but also to provide climatic limits for formation classes within each of the biochores. For example, it is possible to identify on the basis of numerical data an oak-hickory climate as distinct from the birch-maple, and a bunch grass climate distinct from the sagebrush. The problem of non-climatically controlled vegetation associations such as the low latitude pines and savanna are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The presence of brominated flame retardant ({BFR}) chemicals, and particularly polybrominated diphenyl ethers ({PBDEs}), tetrabromobisphenol A ({TBBPA}) and hexabromocyclododecane ({HBCD}), has become of increasing concern to scientists over the past decade. Environmental studies conducted primarily in Europe, Japan and North America indicate that these chemicals are ubiquitous in sediment and biota. The levels of {PBDEs} seem to be increasing, and several trends, including in humans, indicate that this increase may be rapid. The occurrence of high concentrations of certain {PBDE} isomers may be sufficient to elicit adverse effects in some wildlife. There is also concern that levels could cause adverse effects in sensitive human populations such as young children, indigenous peoples, and fish consumers. However, our knowledge about these chemicals, their sources, environmental behavior, and toxicity is limited, making risk assessment difficult. In this paper, the current state of knowledge is reviewed and areas for further research recommended to improve future monitoring and risk assessment efforts.},

Recession analysis of discharge Q shows that while the relationship between {dQ}/dt and Q is approximately consistent with a linear reservoir for the hillslope, there is a deviation from linearity that becomes progressively larger with increasing spatial scale. To account for these scale differences conceptual models of streamflow recession are defined at both the hillslope scale and the watershed scale, and an assessment made as to whether models at the hillslope scale can be aggregated to be consistent with models at the watershed scale.},

	abstract = {Summary
The methods kriging with external drift ({KED}) and indicator kriging with external drift ({IKED}) are used for the spatial interpolation of hourly rainfall from rain gauges using additional information from radar, daily precipitation of a denser network, and elevation. The techniques are illustrated using data from the storm period of the 10th to the 13th of August 2002 that led to the extreme flood event in the Elbe river basin in Germany. Cross-validation is applied to compare the interpolation performance of the {KED} and {IKED} methods using different additional information with the univariate reference methods nearest neighbour ({NN}) or Thiessen polygons, inverse square distance weighting ({IDW}), ordinary kriging ({OK}) and ordinary indicator kriging ({IK}). Special attention is given to the analysis of the impact of the semivariogram estimation on the interpolation performance. Hourly and average semivariograms are inferred from daily, hourly and radar data considering either isotropic or anisotropic behaviour using automatic and manual fitting procedures.

The multivariate methods {KED} and {IKED} clearly outperform the univariate ones with the most important additional information being radar, followed by precipitation from the daily network and elevation, which plays only a secondary role here. The best performance is achieved when all additional information are used simultaneously with {KED}. The indicator-based kriging methods provide, in some cases, smaller root mean square errors than the methods, which use the original data, but at the expense of a significant loss of variance. The impact of the semivariogram on interpolation performance is not very high. The best results are obtained using an automatic fitting procedure with isotropic variograms either from hourly or radar data.},

The best-available {USDA} soil series data were obtained for 20 Arizona watersheds and 10 groups of New Mexico natural runoff plots. The hydrologic soil groups ({HSG}) were determined from either direct {USDA} assignment or textural properties and compared with the {HSGs} required by the {CNs} and the cover condition. This study showed a standard error of about one {HSG}, resulting in an error in {CN} of approximately seven units when using the best-available data.

To this end, remote sensing ({RS}) satellite digital data from 1989 and 2000 were used for land use and land cover classification using a maximum likelihood classifier algorithm of supervised classification for {CN}-generation. Runoff was estimated for each grid by using a distributed-{CN} approach and averaged for the whole watershed by using a weighted-runoff approach. The estimated runoff values were compared with those from the traditional composite-{CN} technique. In both cases of initial abstraction (Ia) taken as 0.2 S and 0.3 S (where S is the potential maximum retention), the estimated runoff caused by distributed {CN} technique was more than that caused by the composite-{CN} approach. The difference in runoff values was more for Ia=0.3S than that for Ia=0.2S; runoff caused by distributed {CN} with Ia=0.2S matched more closely with the observed. Furthermore, the difference was very high for small events, moderate for medium, and low for high rainfall events; it was very high for the watershed exhibiting greater {CN} variation.},

	abstract = {The amount and spatial distribution of deep drainage (downward movement of water across the bottom of the root zone) and groundwater recharge affect the quantity and quality of increasingly limited groundwater in arid and semiarid regions. We synthesize research from the fields of ecology and hydrology to address the issue of deep drainage in arid and semiarid regions. We start with a recently developed hydrological model that accurately simulates soil water potential and geochemical profiles measured in thick ({\textgreater}50 m), unconsolidated vadose zones. Model results indicate that, since the climate change that marked the onset of the Holocene period 10 000-15 000 years ago, there has been no deep drainage in vegetated interdrainage areas and that continuous, relatively low ({\textless} - 1 {MPa}) soil water potentials have been maintained at depths of 2-3 m. A conceptual model consistent with these results proposes that the native, xeric-shrub-dominated, plant communities that gained dominance during the Holocene generated and maintained these conditions. We present three lines of ecological evidence that support the conceptual model. First, xeric shrubs have sufficiently deep rooting systems with low extraction limits to generate the modeled conditions. Second, the characteristic deep-rooted soil-plant systems store sufficient water to effectively buffer deep soil from climatic fluctuations in these dry environments, allowing stable conditions to persist for long periods of time. And third, adaptations resulting in deep, low-extraction-limit rooting systems confer significant advantages to xeric shrubs in arid and semiarid environments. We then consider conditions in arid and semiarid regions in which the conceptual model may not apply, leading to the expectation that portions of many arid and semiarid watersheds supply some deep drainage. Further ecohydrologic research is required to elucidate critical climatic and edaphic thresholds, evaluate the role of important physiological processes (such as hydraulic redistribution), and evaluate the role of deep roots in terms of carbon costs, nutrient uptake, and whole-plant development.},

The tools are special purpose {FORTRAN} programs interfaced with general-purpose raster and vector spatial analysis and relational data base management packages. The first phase of analysis is a conditioning phase that generates three data sets: the original {DEM} with depressions filled, a data set indicating the flow direction for each cell, and a flow accumulation data set in which each cell receives a value equal to the number of cells that drain to it. The original {DEM} and these three derivative data sets can then be processed in a variety of ways to optionally delineate drainage networks, overland paths, watersheds for user-specified locations, sub-watersheds for the major tributaries of a drainage network, or pour point linkages between watersheds. The computer-generated drainage lines and watershed polygons and the pour point linkage information can be transferred to vector-based geographic information systems for further analysis. Comparisons between these computer generated features and their manually delineated counterparts generally show close agreement, indicating that these software tools will save analyst time spent in manual interpretation and digitizing.},

	abstract = {A multi-criteria model evaluation protocol is presented to check the performance of rainfall-runoff models during model calibration and validation phases based on a high frequency (e.g. hourly, daily) river flow series. The multiple criteria or objectives are based on multiple and non-commensurable measures of information derived from river flow series by means of a number of sequential time series processing tasks. These include separation of the river flow series in subflows, split of the series in nearly independent quick and slow flow hydrograph periods, and the extraction of nearly independent peak and low flows. The protocol accounts for the statistical assumptions and requirements on independency and homoscedasticity of the model residuals, significantly advanced through the use of nearly independent flow values extracted from the flow series. Next to the separate evaluation of the subflow recessions, the quick and slow runoff peak and low values and event volumes, also the performance of the model in predicting extreme high and low flow statistics is validated. To support the time series processing tasks as well as the application of the multi-criteria model evaluation protocol, a Microsoft Excel-based tool ({WETSPRO}: Water Engineering Time Series {PROcessing} tool) has been developed. It is based on the assessment of graphical displays, which complement traditional goodness-of-fit statistics.},

These models include variants of the Thornthwaite-Mather model, the Palmer model, and the more recent Thomas abcd model. Prediction errors are relatively similar among the models. However, simulated values of state variables such as soil moisture storage differ substantially among the models, and fitted parameter values for different models sometimes indicated an entirely different type of basin response to precipitation. Some problems in parameter identification are noted, including difficulties in identifying an appropriate time lag factor for the Thornthwaite-Mather-type model for basins with little groundwater storage, very high correlations between upper and lower storages in the Palmer-type model, and large sensitivity of parameter a of the abcd model to bias in estimates of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Modifications to the threshold concept of the Thornthwaite-Mather model were statistically valid for the six stations in northern New Jersey. The abcd model resulted in a simulated seasonal cycle of groundwater levels similar to fluctuations observed in nearby wells by with greater persistence. These results suggest that extreme caution should be used in attaching physical significance to model parameters and in using the state variables of the models in indices of drought and basin productivity.},

	abstract = {Data substantiating perched conditions in layered bedrock uplands are rare and have not been widely reported. Field observations in layered sedimentary bedrock in southwestern Wisconsin, {USA}, provide evidence of a stable, laterally extensive perched aquifer. Data from a densely instrumented field site show a perched aquifer in shallow dolomite, underlain by a shale-and-dolomite aquitard approximately 25 m thick, which is in turn underlain by sandstone containing a 30-m-thick unsaturated zone above a regional aquifer. Heads in water supply wells indicate that perched conditions extend at least several kilometers into hillsides, which is consistent with published modeling studies. Observations of unsaturated conditions in the sandstone over a 4-year period, historical development of the perched aquifer, and perennial flow from upland springs emanating from the shallow dolomite suggest that perched groundwater is a stable hydrogeologic feature under current climate conditions. Water-table hydrographs exhibit apparent differences in the amount and timing of recharge to the perched and regional flow systems; steep hydraulic gradients and tritium and chloride concentrations suggest there is limited hydraulic connection between the two. Recognition and characterization of perched flow systems have practical importance because their groundwater flow and transport pathways may differ significantly from those in underlying flow systems. Construction of multi-aquifer wells and groundwater withdrawal in perched systems can further alter such pathways.},

Sixteen hydrological variables were used and low-flow and entire-flow regionalizations were derived. The low-flow regionalization was spatially indistinct and therefore unusable, but the entire-flow regionalization produced five distinctive and spatially significant regions. Least-squares relationships were calculated between mean annual runoff, catchment area and coefficient of variation of annual flows, and the 16 variables. Rivers in the dry western districts of Victoria exhibit high variability of annual, monthly and peak flows, and low specific low flows. The converse is true for rivers in the western highlands of Victoria. Stream regionalizations are a useful tool for stream ecologists, and may be used for generating hypotheses, for detecting representative rivers and for producing baseline stream surveys.{\textless}/P{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This paper presents the findings of a study aimed at decomposing a flow hydrograph into different segments based on physical concepts in a catchment, and modelling different segments using different technique viz. conceptual and artificial neural networks ({ANNs}). An integrated modelling framework is proposed capable of modelling infiltration, base flow, evapotranspiration, soil moisture accounting, and certain segments of the decomposed flow hydrograph using conceptual techniques and the complex, non-linear, and dynamic rainfall-runoff process using {ANN} technique. Specifically, five different multi-layer perceptron ({MLP}) and two self-organizing map ({SOM}) models have been developed. The rainfall and streamflow data derived from the Kentucky River catchment were employed to test the proposed methodology and develop all the models. The performance of all the models was evaluated using seven different standard statistical measures. The results obtained in this study indicate that (a) the rainfall-runoff relationship in a large catchment consists of at least three or four different mappings corresponding to different dynamics of the underlying physical processes, (b) an integrated approach that models the different segments of the decomposed flow hydrograph using different techniques is better than a single {ANN} in modelling the complex, dynamic, non-linear, and fragmented rainfall runoff process, (c) a simple model based on the concept of flow recession is better than an {ANN} to model the falling limb of a flow hydrograph, and (d) decomposing a flow hydrograph into the different segments corresponding to the different dynamics based on the physical concepts is better than using the soft decomposition employed using {SOM}.},

It highlights the importance of developing a conceptual understanding of the influence of geology on recharge mechanisms and recharge rates. Uncertainties in recharge estimates through tills are examined by a study of the available literature, combined with sensitivity analyses of soil moisture budget parameters and of hypothetical scenarios of till properties and hydraulic gradients that are realistic for Irish conditions. The sensitivity analyses demonstrate that till properties have a greater influence over recharge than the soil moisture budgeting parameters. Results are considered in terms of recharge coefficients, representing the proportion of effective precipitation that becomes actual recharge to the aquifer. The literature review identifies a range in recharge coefficients from 4\% to 90\% in selected field and catchment scale studies from bedrock aquifers in Ireland and the U.K. The sensitivity analyses are able to simulate a similar range in recharge coefficient of 2\% to 80\% by varying only till permeability, thickness and vertical hydraulic gradients. In the scenarios examined, the greatest sensitivity to vertical till permeability lies between 0.001 m/day and 0.01 m/day. The sensitivity to soil moisture budgeting parameters is much less apparent. It is concluded that this is due to the dominance of grassland in Ireland and the relatively wet summers, resulting in the limited development of soil moisture deficits by comparison with some parts of the U.K.},

(2005) pointed out several inconsistencies in the soil moisture accounting ({SMA}) procedure used in the {SCS}-{CN} method and developed a procedure that is more consistent from the {SMA} viewpoint. However, the model proposed by them does not have any expression for initial soil moisture store level (V0) and hence there is a scope for further improvement. Like the original method, there is sudden jump in V0 and therefore a quantum jump in computed runoff is possible. In the present study, an attempt is made to develop an expression for V0 to make the model a continuous watershed model. Then, the performance of the new model is compared with the model proposed by Michel et al. and the original {SCS}-{CN} model by applying them in a large number of small watersheds in the United States. The present model was found to perform significantly better than both the original {SCS}-{CN} model and the model proposed by Michel et al. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Six approaches for downscaling climate model outputs for use in hydrologic simulation were evaluated, with particular emphasis on each method's ability to produce precipitation and other variables used to drive a macroscale hydrology model applied at much higher spatial resolution than the climate model. Comparisons were made on the basis of a twenty-year retrospective (1975–1995) climate simulation produced by the {NCAR}-{DOE} Parallel {ClimateModel} ({PCM}), and the implications of the comparison for a future(2040–2060) {PCM} climate scenario were also explored. The six approaches were made up of three relatively simple statistical downscaling methods – linear interpolation ({LI}), spatial disaggregation ({SD}), and bias-correction and spatial disaggregation ({BCSD}) – each applied to both {PCM} output directly(at T42 spatial resolution), and after dynamical downscaling via a Regional Climate Model ({RCM} – at 1/2-degree spatial resolution), for downscaling the climate model outputs to the 1/8-degree spatial resolution of the hydrological model. For the retrospective climate simulation, results were compared to an observed gridded climatology of temperature and precipitation, and gridded hydrologic variables resulting from forcing the hydrologic model with observations. The most significant findings are that the {BCSD} method was successful in reproducing the main features of the observed hydrometeorology from the retrospective climate simulation, when applied to both {PCM} and {RCM} outputs. Linear interpolation produced better results using {RCM} output than {PCM} output, but both methods ({PCM}-{LI} and {RCM}-{LI}) lead to unacceptably biased hydrologic simulations. Spatial disaggregation of the {PCM} output produced results similar to those achieved with the {RCM} interpolated output; nonetheless, neither {PCM} nor {RCM} output was useful for hydrologic simulation purposes without a bias-correction step. For the future climate scenario, only the {BCSD}-method (using {PCM} or {RCM}) was able to produce hydrologically plausible results. With the {BCSD} method, the {RCM}-derived hydrology was more sensitive to climate change than the {PCM}-derived hydrology.},

	abstract = {Sediment is an important pollutant for Lake Erie and its tributaries as a carrier of other substances and as a pollutant in its own right. Environmental managers have called for major reductions in sediment loadings in Lake Erie tributaries. In this study, 30-yr (1975–2005) datasets with daily resolution are analyzed to identify and interpret trends in sediment concentrations and loads in major {US} tributaries to Lake Erie. The Maumee and Sandusky Rivers in agricultural northwest Ohio show continual decreases throughout this period, but the River Raisin shows increases, especially in the last decade. The urban and forested Cuyahoga River shows little trend before 2000 but shows increases since then. The mostly forested Grand River shows strong decreases before 1995, little change thereafter until the early 2000s, and then increases. In most cases, the greatest decreases or smallest increases, depending on the river, are associated with summer and fall and with low flow conditions, whereas the smallest decreases or greatest increases are associated with the spring and with high flow conditions. Analysis of concentration–flow relationships indicates that these changes are not due to weather but reflect positive and negative anthropogenic influences. Sediment decreases in the northwestern Ohio tributaries seem to reflect the successful use of agricultural practices to reduce erosion and prevent sediment loss. Opportunities for further reductions in sediment loads and concentrations lie in better management of sediment losses during winter and spring.},

	abstract = {River water temperature is a common target of water quality models at the watershed scale, owing to its principal role in shaping biogeochemical processes and in stream ecology. Usually, models include physically-based, deterministic formulations to calculate water temperatures from detailed meteorological information, which usually comes from meteorological stations located far from the river reaches. However, alternative empirical approaches have been proposed, that usually depend on air temperature as master variable. This study explored the performance of a semidistributed water quality application modelling river water temperature in a Mediterranean watershed, using three different approaches. First, a deterministic approach was used accounting for the different heat exchange components usually considered in water temperature models. Second, an empirical approximation was applied using the equilibrium temperature concept, assuming a linear relationship with air temperature. And third, a hybrid approach was constructed, in which the temperature equilibrium concept and the deterministic approach were combined. Results showed that the hybrid approach gave the best results, followed by the empirical approximation. The deterministic formulation gave the worst results. The hybrid approach not only fitted daily river water temperatures, but also adequately modelled the daily temperature range (maximum–minimum daily temperature). Other river water features directly dependent on water temperature, such as river intrusion depth in lentic systems (i.e. the depth at which the river inflow plunges to equilibrate density differences with lake water), were also correctly modelled even at hourly time steps. However, results for the different heat fluxes between river and atmosphere were very unrealistic. Although direct evidence of discrepancies between meteorological drivers measured at the meteorological stations and the actual river microclimate was not found, the use of models including empirical or hybrid formulations depending mainly on air temperature is recommended if only meteorological data from locations far from the river reaches are available.

	abstract = {Abstract Two single‐layer models of soil water balance were tested against fortnightly neutron probe field measurements of soil water at four North Island sites. The first model assumed constant evapotranspiration from field capacity to wilting point (the “Veihmeyer” approach), whereas the second model simulated a “two‐phase” accounting of the soil moisture balance‐potential evapotranspiration above a critical water deficit and declining evapotranspiration below this deficit. The Veihmeyer model was found to be the better choice for modelling soil water in layers of 0–50 and 0–70 cm, corresponding to the zone of most pasture root activity, but the two‐phase approach had advantages when modelling the full depth of sampled soil profile (about 120 cm). The available water capacities used in the models were derived from the neutron probe measurements. Soil moisture profiles were measured fortnightly from September 1986 to September 1988. Regression of predicted moisture deficit against measured deficit explained between 88 and 97\% of the variance in most model runs for three of the four sites, with soil moisture deficit errors typically in the range of 10–20 mm. Overall, at these sites the accuracy figures for the two‐phase model runs were similar to those for the Veihmeyer model runs. The fourth soil profile was disturbed and therefore atypical. In general, there was little advantage to be gained in using daily evapotranspiration data over monthly mean evapotranspiration data. Results from this study suggest that for modelling pasture soil moisture on time scales of 2 weeks or more, the simpler Veihmeyer model is as good as the two‐phase model and can be applied with confidence to many pastoral agricultural applications such as irrigation planning and drought assessments.},

Vegetation is modelled as a dynamic component with the modified Gash model. The equation is solved with a modified second order Leapfrog explicit finite difference scheme with centred time and space derivatives. The model was validated with standard analytical solutions. Evaluation with results from field campaigns in the Volta Basin of West Africa during the 2002 rainfall season indicates good agreement, with r2 values ranging from 0·89 to 0·96. The developed method will be useful in studying the dynamics of surface runoff generation under complex microtopographic conditions, spatially varying soil hydraulic characteristics and temporally dynamic rainfall intensity, as found in many tropical catchments.

	abstract = {Legacy soil maps typically consist of a tessellation of polygon soil map unit delineations where the map units consist of a defined assemblage of soil classes assumed to exist in more-or-less fixed proportions. There are several limitations in this kind of mapping approach that relate to the original intent of the soil survey, the effect of mapping scale, and the nature of soil polygon boundaries. Yet perhaps a more fundamental limitation is the fact that most of the time, the soil classes that comprise the soil map units are not mapped individually: in effect their spatial distributions are unknown beyond the qualitative indications given in the accompanying soil map unit report.

Spatial disaggregation of soil map units attempts to map the spatial distribution of the individual soil classes that comprise a legacy soil map. We developed an approach called “Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees” ({DSMART}). {DSMART} samples the polygons of a legacy soil map and uses classification trees to generate a number of realisations of the potential soil class distribution. The realisations are then used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the individual soil classes. These estimates are mapped as raster grids, which can overcome some of the limitations of mapping scale and polygon boundaries inherent in the original legacy soil map.

We demonstrate the {DSMART} approach on a legacy soil map from the former Dalrymple Shire in central Queensland, Australia. We mapped the estimated probability of occurrence of the 71 soil classes in the legacy soil map, as well as the most probable soil class, second-most-probable soil class and the degree of confusion between them as determined by a confusion index. Validation on 285 observed soil profiles indicated that for 48.4\% of the validation profiles, the observed soil class was identified in the top three most probable soil classes.},

	abstract = {Many ecosystems have evolved under conditions where ground water is critical to the survival of the unique species contained therein. One example is Nebraska’s Sand Hills fens. The Sand Hills region comprises lush interdunal valleys amid grass-stabilized dunes. One valley type, fens, are ground water-fed wetlands that have several meters of saturated, organic soils comprising peat formed under anaerobic conditions where plant growth exceeds decomposition. These fens support unique flora and fauna such as rush aster and northern redbelly dace that are typically found in more boreal regions of North America. This study characterized the hydrogeology of a representative fen in the Jumbo Valley to explore how these relict species survive in a hot, arid climate and to understand present and historical relations between ground water and these unique ecosystems. Results indicate that ground water’s present role in sustaining the fens is twofold: (1) wetland plant transpiration of shallow ground water across the valley creates a cooler, humid microclimate that sustains the fens in the region’s hot, arid climate and (2) the large volume of ground water pumped through the fens by plant transpiration transports necessary nutrients to the root zone. Results suggest that, in the past, in addition to its sustaining role, ground water also played a vital role in fen development and in fen preservation through nearly 15,000 years of existence. Thus, as with like ecosystems, the role of ground water must be considered in future Sand Hills fen protection, restoration, and management.},

	abstract = {The fundamental rationale for statistical downscaling is that the raw outputs of climate change experiments from General Circulation Models ({GCMs}) are an inadequate basis for assessing the effects of climate change on land-surface processes at regional scales. This is because the spatial resolution of {GCMs} is too coarse to resolve important sub-grid scale processes (most notably those pertaining to the hydrological cycle) and because {GCM} output is often unreliable at individual and sub-grid box scales. By establishing empirical relationships between grid-box scale circulation indices (such as atmospheric vorticity and divergence) and sub-grid scale surface predictands (such as precipitation), statistical downscaling has been proposed as a practical means of bridging this spatial difference. This study compared three sets of current and future rainfall-runoff scenarios. The scenarios were constructed using: (1) statistically downscaled {GCM} output; (2) raw {GCM} output; and (3) raw {GCM} output corrected for elevational biases. Atmospheric circulation indices and humidity variables were extracted from the output of the {UK} Meteorological Office coupled ocean-atmosphere {GCM} ({HadCM}2) in order to downscale daily precipitation and temperature series for the Animas River in the San Juan River basin, Colorado. Significant differences arose between the modelled snowpack and flow regimes of the three future climate scenarios. Overall, the raw {GCM} output suggests larger reductions in winter/spring snowpack and summer runoff than the downscaling, relative to current conditions. Further research is required to determine the generality of the water resource implications for other regions, {GCM} outputs and downscaled scenarios.},

In this technique, a modified Soil Conservation Service curve number ({SCS}-{CN}) method and a two-dimensional overland flow model were combined. Modified {SCS}-{CN} method estimated daily net rainfall fractions were used as an input to the overland flow model along with other remote-sensing-derived inputs such as the digital elevation model ({DEM}), rainfall, and roughness factor for routing of the produced runoff. The model works on a cell basis and routs produced runoff from one cell to next following the maximum downslope directions. The flow model uses the diffusive wave approximations of the St. Venant equations for routing surface water. The model was tested by calibrating the Strickler coefficient K, which is inversely proportional to resistance to flow, and comparing the observed and simulated daily change in the water levels for two gauging sites. The calibrated average values of K for different subcatchments were 15.7, 21.7, 23.4, and 28.4 for Kurkuti, Sijhora, between the gauging sites, and downstream catchments, respectively. The model was tested for some statistical parameters like the Nash Sutcliffe coefficientand {RMSE} using residuals between observed and simulated data, and found to be within the acceptable limits. The results show that the hybrid technique works well to extend the application of curve number to address the routing phase of runoff.},

	abstract = {Summary
Regional ground-water recharge estimates for Minnesota were compared to estimates made on the basis of four local- and basin-scale methods. Three local-scale methods (unsaturated-zone water balance, water-table fluctuations ({WTF}) using three approaches, and age dating of ground water) yielded point estimates of recharge that represent spatial scales from about 1 to about 1000\&\#xa0;m2. A fourth method ({RORA}, a basin-scale analysis of streamflow records using a recession-curve-displacement technique) yielded recharge estimates at a scale of 10–1000s of km2. The {RORA} basin-scale recharge estimates were regionalized to estimate recharge for the entire State of Minnesota on the basis of a regional regression recharge ({RRR}) model that also incorporated soil and climate data. Recharge rates estimated by the {RRR} model compared favorably to the local and basin-scale recharge estimates. {RRR} estimates at study locations were about 41\% less on average than the unsaturated-zone water-balance estimates, ranged from 44\% greater to 12\% less than estimates that were based on the three {WTF} approaches, were about 4\% less than the age dating of ground-water estimates, and were about 5\% greater than the {RORA} estimates. Of the methods used in this study, the {WTF} method is the simplest and easiest to apply. Recharge estimates made on the basis of the {UZWB} method were inconsistent with the results from the other methods. Recharge estimates using the {RRR} model could be a good source of input for regional ground-water flow models; {RRR} model results currently are being applied for this purpose in {USGS} studies elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Both climate change and human activities are known to have induced changes to hydrology. Consequently, quantifying the net impact of human contribution to the streamflow change is a challenge. In this paper, a decomposition method based on the Budyko hypothesis is used to quantify the climate (i.e., precipitation and potential evaporation change) and direct human impact on mean annual streamflow ({MAS}) for 413 watersheds in the contiguous United States. The data for annual precipitation, runoff, and potential evaporation are obtained from the international Model Parameter Estimation Experiment ({MOPEX}), which is often assumed to only include gauges unaffected by human interferences. The data are split into two periods (1948–1970 and 1971–2003) to quantify the change over time. Although climate is found to affect {MAS} more than direct human impact, the results show that assuming the {MOPEX} data set to be unaffected by human activities is far from realistic. Climate change causes increasing {MAS} in most watersheds, while the direct human-induced change is spatially heterogeneous in the contiguous United States, with strong regional patterns, e.g., human activities causing increased {MAS} in the Midwest and significantly decreased {MAS} in the High Plains. The climate- and human-induced changes are found to be more severe in arid regions, where water is limited. Comparing the results to a collection of independent data sets indicates that the estimated direct human impacts on {MAS} in this largely nonurban set of watersheds might be attributed to several human activities, such as cropland expansion, irrigation, and the construction of reservoirs.},

Two solvent sequences, methanol-diethyl ether-water (sample) and methanol-acetone-water (sample), gave satisfactory blank levels without reducing the adsorption capacity. Separate studies of the adsorption, desorption and evaporation steps showed that for a great number of non-polar compounds with different functional groups the recovery was mainly limited by losses in the evaporation step. For polar compounds such as certain alcohols and phenols the adsorption efficiency was the most critical factor. Losses during the desorption step could be made negligible except for naphthalene and anthracene. A study of interaction effects between humic substances in the water sample and the low-molecular-weight compounds to be analysed by gas chromatography did not give any evidence of a decrease in recovery or increase in breakthrough for any of the surface-water samples. Comparisons with dichloromethane extraction and stripping enrichment showed that adsorption on {XAD}-2 can give blank levels and recoveries which are in some respects superior. Furthermore, the {XAD}-2 technique and dichloromethane extraction were less sensitive to interaction effects from humic substances and less sensitive than the stripping technique.},

The Gash analytical model has been widely used to estimate the forest interception loss at field scale. In this study, we proposed a simple model to estimate rainfall interception loss of heterogeneous forest at regional scale with several reasonable assumptions using remote sensing observations. The model is a modified Gash analytical model using easily measured parameters of forest structure from satellite data and extends the original Gash model from point-scale to the regional scale. Preliminary results, using remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}) products, field measured rainfall data, and meteorological data of the Automatic Weather Station ({AWS}) over a picea crassifolia forest in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China, showed reasonable accuracy in estimating rainfall interception loss at both the Dayekou experimental site (R2 = 0.91, {RMSE} = 0.34 mm∙d −1) and the Pailugou experimental site (R2 = 0.82, {RMSE} = 0.6 mm∙d −1), compared with ground measurements based on per unit area of forest. The interception loss map of the study area was shown to be strongly heterogeneous. The modified model has robust physics and is insensitive to the input parameters, according to the sensitivity analysis using numerical simulations. The modified model appears to be stable and easy to be applied for operational estimation of interception loss over large areas.},

	abstract = {Summary 
Estimating uncertainty of hydrologic forecasting is valuable to water resources and other relevant decision making processes. Recently, Bayesian Neural Networks ({BNNs}) have been proved powerful tools for quantifying uncertainty of streamflow forecasting. In this study, we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) framework ({BNN}-{PIS}) to incorporate the uncertainties associated with parameters, inputs, and structures into {BNNs}. This framework allows the structure of the neural networks to change by removing or adding connections between neurons and enables scaling of input data by using rainfall multipliers. The results show that the new {BNNs} outperform {BNNs} that only consider uncertainties associated with parameters and model structures. Critical evaluation of posterior distribution of neural network weights, number of effective connections, rainfall multipliers, and hyper-parameters shows that the assumptions held in our {BNNs} are not well supported. Further understanding of characteristics of and interactions among different uncertainty sources is expected to enhance the application of neural networks for uncertainty analysis of hydrologic forecasting.},

A five-parameter M3 model is proposed, with storm duration and a new parameter Sabs (potential maximum retention), to overcome most of the above limitations prevailing in the {SCS}-{CN} model. For simplicity and practical applications obviating storm-duration data, a four-parameter M4 model is also proposed. The performance of the suggested and the available models has been evaluated using the data of 82 small watersheds in the United States of America. As demonstrated, the M3 model performs the best, whereas the conventional {SCS}-{CN} model performs the poorest among all the models studied.},

Conventional methods for quantifying parameter uncertainty are difficult to apply to {ANN} weights because of the complexity of these models, and complicated methods developed for this purpose have been not been adopted by water resources practitioners because of the difficulty in implementing them. This paper presents a relatively straightforward Bayesian training method that enables weight uncertainty to be accounted for in {ANN} predictions. The method is applied to a salinity forecasting case study, and the resulting {ANN} is shown to significantly outperform an {ANN} developed using standard approaches in a real-time forecasting scenario. Moreover, the Bayesian approach produces prediction limits that indicate the level of uncertainty in the predictions, which is extremely important if forecasts are to be used with confidence in water resources applications.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the spatial and temporal distribution of natural groundwater recharge is usually a prerequisite for effective groundwater modeling and management. As flow models become increasingly utilized for management decisions, there is an increased need for simple, practical methods to delineate recharge zones and quantify recharge rates. Existing models for estimating recharge distributions are data intensive, require extensive parameterization, and take a significant investment of time in order to establish. The Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey ({WGNHS}) has developed a simple daily soil–water balance ({SWB}) model that uses readily available soil, land cover, topographic, and climatic data in conjunction with a geographic information system ({GIS}) to estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of groundwater recharge at the watershed scale for temperate humid areas. To demonstrate the methodology and the applicability and performance of the model, two case studies are presented: one for the forested Trout Lake watershed of north central Wisconsin, {USA} and the other for the urban-agricultural Pheasant Branch Creek watershed of south central Wisconsin, {USA}. Overall, the {SWB} model performs well and presents modelers and planners with a practical tool for providing recharge estimates for modeling and water resource planning purposes in humid areas.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.09.009},
	abstract = {The objective of the work presented in this paper was to investigate how rasters of the probabilities of occurrence of soil classes may be used to create digital soil property maps and maps of their associated uncertainties. The approach we present is formalised in an algorithm we developed called “Digital Soil Property Mapping Using Soil Class Probability Rasters” ({PROPR}).

The soil class probability rasters were derived previously from a spatial disaggregation of the 1:250,000-scale Dalrymple Shire legacy soil polygon map from central Queensland, Australia.

We created digital soil property maps of soil {pH} 1:5 H2O and their uncertainties (as indicated by estimates of the limits of the 90\% prediction interval) at six depth increments down the soil profile (0–5 cm, 5–15 cm, 15–30 cm, 30–60 cm, 60–100 cm, 100–200 cm). The calculation of the weighted mean soil {pH} value for each depth increment at each grid cell was based on reference {pH} values for each soil class and used the probabilities of occurrence at each grid cell as weights.

The calculation of the prediction interval limits for each depth increment involved sampling from the triangular distribution of the soil {pH} of each soil class using the soil class probabilities at each grid cell as weights in order to identify the number of samples to draw from each distribution. The 90\% prediction interval limits were then estimated as the 5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of samples drawn from the soil classes' triangular distributions.

The maps of soil {pH} displayed strong spatial patterns. Soil {pH} generally increased with depth. Uncertainty generally increased with depth. Validation on 300 randomly-selected soil profiles returned a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.193 at the surface increasing to 0.266 at depth. {RMSE} increased with depth from about 0.75 {pH} units at the surface to 1.15 at depth.

Soil class probability rasters are useful for generating digital soil property maps and maps of the associated uncertainties. Validation left room for improvement but the quality of the results is probably strongly affected by the quality of the spatial disaggregation that produced the soil class probability rasters. The {PROPR} approach may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available.

Generation of the soil class probability rasters to use in {PROPR} is a predictive exercise in itself and so is also subject to uncertainty. The probability rasters likely can be derived by several methods including logistic regression and data mining; the probability rasters we used were derived via spatial disaggregation of a legacy soil polygon map.

{PROPR} may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available. The soil class probability rasters need to be produced separately. Information on the within-soil-class variability of the target soil property at each depth increment must be known in order to establish the triangular distributions for the uncertainty estimation.

{PROPR} may reduce reliance on having sufficient soil profile observations in areas where such data is limiting. We used available profile observations to estimate the within-soil-class variability in order to establish triangular distributions for the soil classes in our study area, but the information required to do so could also be derived from legacy reports or expert knowledge.},

Catchments smaller than 250 ha normally have no perennial streams but may have many springs that flow for short distances and then reenter the ground. Land use has been shown to influence the surface hydrology greatly. Tilled cropland is the principal source of flood runoff and stream sediment. Runoff from forest land is minimal regardless of its slope or condition. The occurrence and movement of groundwater are complex, perched water bodies and dry pockets being intermixed with water tables that rise and fall in rapid response to rainfall and snowmelt and in close synchronization with spring flow. Snowmelt produces a distinctive diurnal pattern of both overland flow and groundwater rise, sometimes in midwinter. Overland flow usually peaks about midafternoon and diminishes to near zero a few hours later. The groundwater peak comes early in the morning of the next day. We found little difference in the daily timing of overland flow from north- and south-facing catchments once the melt period had begun. Larger catchments responded to both rainfall and snowmelt much the same as smaller experimental catchments.},

	abstract = {Representation of the hydrological interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere requires considerable improvement, particularly for predicting evapotranspiration feedbacks for use in models of the general circulation ({GCMs}) of the atmosphere. The predictive model developed here attempts to use a water balance approach that extracts information from the masses of catchment-scale time series data available on precipitation, energy-related variables and stream discharge. It begins with a few simple assumptions in order to seek some synthesis of the climate and landscape controls on evapotranspiration and soil moisture feedbacks, and catchment water yields. The model adopts the hydrograph identification approach used in the linear module of the rainfall-runoff model {IHACRES} but replaces the previous statistically based non-linear evapotranspiration loss module by a catchment moisture deficit accounting scheme. One advantage of this more conceptual approach is that evapotranspiration can be output on the same time step at which precipitation and energy variables are available (such as from {GCMs}), and this time step can be shorter (e.g. half hourly) than the discharge time step (e.g. daily) used to calibrate the model parameters.},

	abstract = {Carbonate-sandstone geology in southeastern Minnesota creates a heterogeneous landscape of springs, seeps, and sinkholes that supply groundwater into streams. Air temperatures are effective predictors of water temperature in surface-water dominated streams. However, no published work investigates the relationship between air and water temperatures in groundwater-fed streams ({GWFS}) across watersheds. We used simple linear regressions to examine weekly air-water temperature relationships for 40 {GWFS} in southeastern Minnesota. A 40-stream, composite linear regression model has a slope of 0.38, an intercept of 6.63, and R2 of 0.83. The regression models for {GWFS} have lower slopes and higher intercepts in comparison to surface-water dominated streams. Regression models for streams with high R2 values offer promise for use as predictive tools for future climate conditions. Climate change is expected to alter the thermal regime of groundwater-fed systems, but will do so at a slower rate than surface-water dominated systems. A regression model of intercept vs. slope can be used to identify streams for which water temperatures are more meteorologically than groundwater controlled, and thus more vulnerable to climate change. Such relationships can be used to guide restoration vs. management strategies to protect trout streams.},

This study of observed rainfall and runoff for small, forested watersheds that span the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States showed that curve numbers calibrated for the growing season tended to be smaller than for the dormant season. Forest cutting tended to increase curve numbers. However, the increase in water yield following forest cutting on these watersheds only lasted 1 year to 11 years, thereby limiting the precision of the curve numbers estimated for these brief hydrologic effect periods. This study highlights the need to account for seasonal and forest cutting when estimating runoff from some forested watersheds.},

	abstract = {Efficient numerical simulation of process interactions between infiltration and Hortonian runoff is needed to evaluate patterns of internal state variables and fluxes within a watershed. A fully distributed rainfall–runoff model was developed for event-based studies of space–time watershed processes. A routing hierarchy was defined over the watershed using the D-infinity contributing area algorithm. Computation of ponding time was included to handle variable run-on and rainfall intensity. The Green–Ampt model was adopted to calculate surface infiltration, and the kinematic wave model was used to route Hortonian runoff and channel flow. The model can handle input rainfall, soil parameters, and other properties that vary in space and time. The model was tested first against analytical solutions for idealized overland planes. After a sensitivity analysis to identify the most significant parameters, it was then calibrated and verified using rainfall and streamflow data from the {USDA}-{ARS} Walnut Gulch experimental watershed in Arizona, {USA}. The coefficients of efficiency for runoff volume, peak flow, and time to peak flow with respect to calibration/validation are 0.95/0.65, 0.85/0.09, and 0.69/0.88, respectively. Example applications of the model show its potential for simulating internal states and fluxes. The open-source model is provided for space–time simulation and scaling of event-based Hortonian runoff and infiltration.},

Comparisons of computed and measured stream flow in 28 basins on the Delmarva peninsula show that for some basins the agreement is excellent (regression line essentially equals unity), for other basins the regression line has a slope of one but it is displaced above or below the y=x line, while for other basins, the slope of the regression line differs appreciably from unity. Study of the basins where agreement between computed and measured values is only fair to poor reveals that the patterns of disagreement can be used to provide information on the water holding capacity in the root zone of the soil, on the quantity of deep aquifer recharge within the basin, or on the effect of human modifications within the basin. The technique should also reveal the quantity of interbasin transfers or other consumptive uses within the basin. The water budget, thus, becomes a useful tool to study hydrologic characteristics or their changes over time within a basin.},

	abstract = {{AESTRACT} An evaluation of the Maxey-Eakin method for calculating recharge to ground-water basins in Nevada was performed. The evaluation consisted of comparing Maxey-Eakin estimates with independent estimates of recharge, and analyzing the nature of the differences between the groups of estimates. In the comparison with the Maxey-Eakin estimates, two different groups of independent estimates were used: (1) 40 recharge estimates that were identified from water budgets contained in reports by the Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and (2) 27 recharge estimates that were identified from previous studies that used models. The results of the comparisons indicate generally good agreement between the Maxey-Eakin estimates and both groups of independent estimates. To quantify this agreement, an analysis was conducted to estimate the uncertainty in the Maxey-Eakin method. The analysis produced an upper bound on the standard deviation of the Maxey-Eakin estimate for a given basin. For the group of 40 water-budget estimates, the upper bound on the standard deviation for an individual basin is 4,800 acre-ft/yr, and the corresponding coefficient of variation of the Maxey-Eakin estimate is no greater than 44 percent. For the group of 27 model estimates, the upper bound on the standard deviation is 4,100 acre-ft/yr, and the corresponding coefficient of variation is no greater than 24 percent.},

	abstract = {{AbstractUse} of the Soil Conservation Service curve number ({SCS}-{CN}) approach is very popular among hydrologists. Despite this, its applications in water quality modeling have been very limited. For the first time, the present work explores the potential of the {SCS}-{CN} approach in water quality modeling of the river bank filtration process using a theoretical framework. The approach relates the curve number ({CN}) with the filtration/kinetic coefficient and the input applied to the system. The approach is tested for its effectiveness using the field data collected at the river bank filtration site at Haridwar, India. The {CN} is found to be dependent on travel time between source water and the abstraction well in addition to the influent concentration. For very low or very high values of influent concentration, the curve number exhibits an asymptotic variation approaching 100 and 0, respectively. Using the data on source water quality and the travel time, it is possible to compute the curve number and, subsequently, the filtrate quality at an abstraction well.},

Most of the recently developed {SCS}-{CN}–based models including the original one ignore the effect of storm duration or rainfall intensity on surface runoff, an important aspect of the rainfall-runoff model. Some of these models have, however, included the antecedent moisture conditions. In this study, storm duration is incorporated in a recently modified version of the {SCS}-{CN} method to derive a more advanced model. This version is found to perform generally better than the other on the data of 60 small U.S. watersheds. The former model performed significantly better than the latter on the watersheds dominated by silty soils and cultivated land uses.},

If the discharge measurement is properly centered in the baseflow period the resulting estimate will be fairly precise, even if the baseflow recession coefficient is not known. Furthermore, based on an assumed probability distribution of the baseflow coefficient it is possible to estimate the uncertainty of the baseflow volume estimate.

The majority of models attempt to simulate the process of percolation to groundwater from an overlying soil water store, which may be conceived as a single store or a series combination of stores. However, these models have seldom been tested against field observations, and therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the performance of 13 single store and two-store models, selected from the literature, using an 11 years daily record from a weighing lysimeter 2.4\&\#xa0;m deep at Coshocton, {OH}, supporting a pasture grass. The percolation data are measured directly, while the volume of water in the soil column is measured by weighing the monolith every 5\&\#xa0;min. Use of data from three adjacent non-weighing lysimeters enabled an assessment of the spatial variability of groundwater recharge. The results of the study show that five models perform well in simulating recharge to a level consistent with spatial variability over a scale of a few metres, but did not perform as well in simulating variations of total soil water in the column, particularly during periods of high evapotranspiration. All the models, however, tend to underestimate the sharp peaks in recharge which may occur in extreme events.},

Daily fields of 500 {hPa} heights from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Reanalysis are analyzed over N. America and the N. Atlantic to assess changes in north-south (Rossby) wave characteristics associated with {AA} and the relaxation of poleward thickness gradients. Two effects are identified that each contribute to a slower eastward progression of Rossby waves in the upper-level flow: 1) weakened zonal winds, and 2) increased wave amplitude. These effects are particularly evident in autumn and winter consistent with sea-ice loss, but are also apparent in summer, possibly related to earlier snow melt on high-latitude land. Slower progression of upper-level waves would cause associated weather patterns in mid-latitudes to be more persistent, which may lead to an increased probability of extreme weather events that result from prolonged conditions, such as drought, flooding, cold spells, and heat waves.},

In this study, the {SCS}-{CN} technique adapted for Indian conditions has been used for the generation of {CNs} for an ungauged watershed. The {USDA} {SCS}-{CN} method is used for estimating the runoff depth in the Manimuktha subwatershed. Monthly and annual runoff values have been obtained from the daily runoff values of the watershed. A base map, soil map, and land use map of the study area have been prepared using remote sensing data and Survey of India ({SOI}) toposheets. The vector layers have been generated in {GIS} software. The {SCS} model is then applied to estimate the daily runoff from the watershed and validated, comparing it with the observed runoff of a few selected events of the monsoon periods of 1980–2009. The statistical analysis indicates that the {SCS}-{CN} method can be applied to predict runoff depths of an ungauged watershed. The present study reveals that the remote sensing and {GIS}-based {SCS}-{CN} model can be used effectively to estimate the runoff from the ungauged Indian watersheds of similar geohydrological characteristics.},

	abstract = {The Beaverkill Watershed in the Catskill Mountains of New York, U.S.A., shows evidence of high summer stream temperatures throughout critical trout habitat. Because habitat quality, as characterized by stream temperature, dramatically influences trout communities, it is important for biologists to identify and map these characteristics and to monitor how they change over time. Stream temperatures were recorded over time throughout the Beaverkill Watershed and were used to identify thermal refugia and areas of thermal stress. Seventy-two temperature loggers were placed throughout the watershed during the summer of 2000. Three geostatistical metrics for predicting temperature across the watershed were constructed and evaluated. The first metric utilized the shortest path between temperature loggers without using stream network information. A second metric used distances calculated along the stream network in both upstream and downstream directions. Our final metric was a modified network system in which the distances were weighted by stream order. Each metric was found to provide predictive capability, with added complexity improving the accuracy of represented stream temperatures.Dans le système hydrographique de Beaverkill dans les monts Catskill du New York, E.-U., il y a des indices de températures élevées en été dans tout l'habitat critique de la truite. Parce que la qualité de l'habitat, telle que définie par la température de l'eau, influence fortement les communautés de truites, il est important que les biologistes identifient et cartographient ces températures et suivent leur évolution dans le temps. La température a été enregistrée dans tout le réseau hydrographique de Beaverkill à l'aide de 72 thermomètres enregistreurs à l'été 2000, ce qui a permis d'identifier les refuges et les points de stress thermique. Trois métriques géostatistiques ont été mises au point et évaluées pour prédire la température dans l'ensemble du réseau. La première métrique est la distance minimale entre deux enregistreurs sans tenir compte de renseignements provenant du réseau hydrographique. La seconde métrique utilise les distances calculées le long du réseau, tant vers l'amont que vers l'aval. La dernière métrique est un système de réseau modifié dans lequel les distances sont pondérées en fonction de l'ordre du cours d'eau. Chaque métrique possède un pouvoir de prédiction particulier et la complexité croissante des métriques améliore la justesse de leurs représentations des températures des cours d'eau.[Traduit par la Rédaction]},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}:  One of the biggest challenges in managing cold water streams in the Midwest is understanding how stream temperature is controlled by the complex interactions among meteorologic processes, channel geometry, and ground water inflow. Inflow of cold ground water, shade provided by riparian vegetation, and channel width are the most important factors controlling summer stream temperatures. A simple screening model was used to quantitatively evaluate the importance of these factors and guide management decisions. The model uses an analytical solution to the heat transport equation to predict steady-state temperature throughout a stream reach. The model matches field data from four streams in southwestern Wisconsin quite well (typically within 1°C) and helps explain the observed warming and cooling trends along each stream reach. The distribution of ground water inflow throughout a stream reach has an important influence on stream temperature, and springs are especially effective at providing thermal refuge for fish. Although simple, this model provides insight into the importance of ground water and the impact different management strategies, such as planting trees to increase shade, may have on summer stream temperature.},

	shorttitle = {Reducing Predictive Uncertainty in {HSPF} Watershed Model Applications},
	abstract = {{WinHSPF} is the interface to the {HSPF} lumped parameter watershed model in the {EPA} {BASINS} modeling system. {WinHSPF} includes a driver for the Parameter Estimation ({PEST}) program. {PEST} calibrates models by minimizing an “objective function” quantifying the misfit between model outputs and corresponding field measurements. Where flow gage, precipitation, and other model data are error free, the model structure perfectly represents actual watersheds, and model parameters are not redundant, minimizing an objective function should result in a single unique input parameter set and highly certain model predictions. In the real world, errors in model input, calibration data, and model structure result in equivalent measures of goodness of fit for wholly distinct input parameter sets. {PEST}, run in predictive mode, identifies those input parameter sets that maximize and minimize a given prediction while satisfying the condition that the model satisfactorily fits historical data. This range of uncertainty in model prediction results from parameter non-uniqueness, and from data and model errors.

The impact of model input and calibration data errors on predictive uncertainty is examined. First, the ability of {PEST} to identify correct input parameter sets under ideal conditions is tested. {PEST} is used to calibrate {HSPF} against a pseudo “observed” time series, i.e. output from a pre-calibrated {HSPF} model. {PEST} is then run in predictive mode to identify minimum and maximum predictions of surface runoff rate. Artificial measurement errors are then imposed on the flow gage and precipitation time series, and other key model inputs. For each alteration of the model input or calibration time series, {PEST} is run in predictive mode to identify the effect on predictive uncertainty. The effects from the following error types are examined: precipitation time series errors including altered storm volumes, overall percent change in precipitation, and a random error function; streamflow gage errors including systematic bias and a random error function; non-representative precipitation and other meteorological gage data (switched with another nearby gage); incorrect fixed input parameters such as stage/discharge relationship and overland flow plane variables; and incorrect parameter range limits.

Methods of insulating model applications from these potential errors are examined. Specifically, the protective effect of different objective function component types against certain error types is demonstrated. Objective function components included in the study are simulated versus measured daily streamflow, cumulative seasonal flow volumes, flow exceedence curves, and other corrective measures. Specific objective function components, found effective in protecting against common errors in model input and/or calibration time series, are identified.},

each river and also just upstream of De Pere dam on the Fox River. Water samples were collected for 
analysis of total, dissolved, and particulate concentrations of {PCB}'s at the nanogram-per-liter level. Loads of {PCB}'s entering Green Bay were 
computed using a total-integration method. The methods used to collect water samples and compute the loads of total {PCB}'s entering the bay 
are described in this report. Graphs showing total {PCB}'s concentrations and loads are presented for 
each site, along with the corresponding data tables. 
These data indicate that the amount of total {PCB}'s entering the bay from the Fox River is greater than from all other major tributaries combined.},

The model used includes physical process like infiltration from rainfall or irrigation, redistribution in soil water zone, plant water uptake in the form of actual evapotranspiration and percolation out of the soil reservoir. In addition, the model considers dynamics of crop root growth model that affect the plant water uptake and hence the soil water in the unsaturated zone. The model satisfactorily simulates the soil water content in the active root zone of the crop on daily basis. Values of the mean absolute relative error ({MARE}) index between the observed and simulated soil water content of the rain-fed mustard in 1998 and 1999 are found to be 0.046 and 0.058, respectively, whereas for irrigated mustard, it is 0.051 in 1999. Prediction efficiency ({PE}) index is found to be 0.98, 0.97 and 0.97 for rain-fed mustard of 1998 and 1999 and irrigated mustard of 1999, respectively. Since the {MARE} index is low and {PE} index is high for both rain-fed and irrigated mustard, the model can be used to simulate the soil water content in the active root zone of the crop.},

The results give insight to the process of interception, provide information on the level of the interception storage of the test species and illustrate the importance of leaf area.

Two interception models were tested. The interception—drainage model gave unsatisfactory results. The modified exponential model proved adequate as long as the proportion of rainfall passing through the canopy could be estimated. This proportion was shown to be a function of leaf area index. The use of this model together with a proposed simplified system is discussed with the view of characterizing an ungauged plant community in which elaborate interception studies have not been undertaken.},

	abstract = {Abstract A parameterization of land surface processes to be included in mesoscale and large-scale meteorological models is presented. The number of parameters has been reduced as much as possible, while attempting to preserve the representation of the physics which controls the energy and water budgets. We distinguish two main classes of parameters. The spatial distribution of primary parameters, i.e., the dominant types of soil and vegetation within each grid cell, can be specified from existing global datasets. The secondary parameters, describing the physical properties of each type of soil and vegetation, can be inferred from measurements or derived from numerical experiments. A single surface temperature is used to represent the surface energy balance of the land/cover system. The soil heat flux is linearly interpolated between its value over bare ground and a value of zero for complete shielding by the vegetation. The ground surface moisture equation includes the effect of gravity and the thermo-hydric coefficients of the equations have been either calculated or calibrated using textural dependent formulations. The calibration has been made using the results of a detailed soil model forced by prescribed atmospheric mean conditions. The results show that the coefficients of the surface soil moisture equation are greatly dependent upon the textural class of the soil, as well as upon its moisture content. The new scheme has been included in a one-dimensional model which allows a complete interaction between the surface and the atmosphere. Several simulations have been performed using data collected during {HAPEX}-{MOBILHY}. These first results show the ability of the parameterization to reproduce the components of the surface energy balance over a wide variety of surface conditions.},

Combining it with the empiric {CN}-method of the {US} Soil Conservation Service ({US}-{SCS}), which is applied to daily rainfall records, it is possible to estimate the runoff, and this way, from the difference between surpluses and runoff, to estimate the net infiltration that would recharge a phreatic aquifer. In order to apply both methods during a sequence of years, it is necessary to predict the number of rain events per month, and the rainfall depth for each event. In this work, the author proposes a methodology based on the theorem of Bayes to estimate the number of occurrences of rainy events in a considered month conditioning the forecast to the monthly rainfall. In addition, an exponential distribution to generate rainfall depth knowing the monthly rainfall was done. Both algorithms were applied in four stations of the southern region of Santa Fe province (Argentina). More than 7,600 forecasts of rain occurrences and rainfall depths were compared with the observed records. Moreover, the runoff values estimated by means of the {US}-{SCS} method, using the observed rainfall and using rainfalls predicted with the algorithms were also compared. In both cases, the obtained results were also very satisfactory. The proposed methodologies allow the correct application of the balance of Thornthwaite and Mather together with the {US}-{SCS} method and a good forecast of monthly runoff and net infiltration.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a one-dimensional stream temperature model that is computationally efficient and highly scalable in both time and space. The model is developed within the framework of state space structure. The time-dependent equations for the conservation of thermal energy in a flowing stream or river are solved using a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian, or semi-Lagrangian, numerical scheme. Solutions are obtained by tracking individual water parcels along their flow characteristics and storing the simulated results at discrete points on a fixed grid. Computational efficiency and accuracy of the numerical scheme are demonstrated by comparison of model estimates with observations of stream temperatures from rivers in the Pacific Northwest as well as with results from a closed-form solution of the energy equation. A preliminary analysis of the impact of climate changes on stream temperature in the Columbia River system illustrates the strengths of the semi-Lagrangian method for addressing water quality issues of regional, national, and, ultimately, global scale. Further development of the semi-Lagrangian method has the potential to improve the ability of water quality planners to perform uncertainty analysis, risk analysis, and forecasting for large, complex river systems.},

This review summarizes procedures and examines new approaches for extraction, isolation, identification and quantification of individual congeners/isomers of the {PCBs} and {OCPs}. Critical to the successful application of this methodology is the collection, preparation, and storage of samples, as well as specific quality control and reporting criteria, and therefore these are also discussed. With the signing of the Stockholm convention on {POPs} and the development of global monitoring programs, there is an increased need for laboratories in developing countries to determine {PCBs} and {OCPs}. Thus, while this review attempts to summarize the current best practices for analysis of {PCBs} and {OCPs}, a major focus is the need for low-cost methods that can be easily implemented in developing countries. A “performance based” process is described whereby individual laboratories can adapt methods best suited to their situations. Access to modern capillary gas chromatography ({GC}) equipment with either electron capture or low-resolution mass spectrometry ({MS}) detection to separate and quantify {OCP}/{PCBs} is essential. However, screening of samples, especially in areas of known use of {OCPs} or {PCBs}, could be accomplished with bioanalytical methods such as specific commercially available enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays and thus this topic is also reviewed. New analytical techniques such two-dimensional {GC} (2D-{GC}) and “fast {GC}” using {GC}–{ECD} may be well-suited for broader use in routine {PCB}/{OCP} analysis in the near future given their relatively low costs and ability to provide high-resolution separations of {PCB}/{OCPs}. Procedures with low environmental impact ({SPME}, microscale, low solvent use, etc.) are increasingly being used and may be particularly suited to developing countries.},

Since adequate pollutant concentration data are lacking for many river systems, but flow data are often available, measures of flow variability may be the only source of information for planning monitoring programs or evaluating the behavior of tributaries on a basin-wide scale. Seven measures of flow variability were developed, and their characteristics were examined using flow data from Great Lakes tributaries. Classification of the tributaries based on flow variability were compared with an event-responsiveness classification of earlier investigators. Lack of agreement is conspicuous, and can be attributed in part to an inadequate chemical data base for many rivers when the earlier classification was established. Cluster analysis was used to reveal the natural groupings of 118 U.S. and Canadian Great Lakes tributaries, based on measures of flow variability. The resulting classification of the tributaries is geographically coherent, and demonstrates that large areas of high flow variability are found in the western and central Lake Erie drainage basin, probably as a result of intense agricultural land use in association with heavy soils. Tributaries draining urban areas also tend to have high flow variability. Most of the tributaries which drain the northern Great Lakes watershed have low flow variability. (Author 's abstract)},

	abstract = {This paper outlines a new methodology to derive evaporation from satellite observations. The approach uses a variety of satellite-sensor products to estimate daily evaporation at a global scale, with a 0.25 degree spatial resolution. Central to this approach is the use of the Priestley and Taylor ({PT}) evaporation model. Because the {PT} equation is driven by net radiation, this strategy avoids the need to specify surface fields of variables, such as the surface conductance, which cannot be detected directly from space. Key distinguishing features are the use of microwave-derived soil moisture, land surface temperature and vegetation density, as well as the use of a detailed rainfall interception module. The modelled evaporation is validated against one year of eddy covariance measurements from 43 stations. The estimated annual totals correlate well with the stations' annual cumulative evaporation (R = 0.84, N = 43) and show a negligible bias (−1.5\%). The validation of the daily time series at each individual station shows good model performance in all vegetation types and climate conditions with an average correlation coefficient of R = 0.84, still lower than the R  = 0.91 found in the validation of the monthly time series. The first global map of annual evaporation developed through this methodology is also presented.},

Using the secant {LM} method for local search, {MICUT} also supports global optimization through the use of a slightly modified version of a stochastic global search technique called Multi-Level Single Linkage [Rinnooy Kan, A.H.G., Timmer, G., 1987a. Stochastic global optimization methods, part I: clustering methods. Math. Program. 39, 27–56; Rinnooy Kan, A.H.G., Timmer, G., 1987b. Stochastic global optimization methods, part ii: multi level methods. Math. Program. 39, 57–78.]. Comparison studies with three environmental models suggest that the stochastic global optimization algorithm in {MICUT} is at least as, and sometimes more efficient and reliable than the global optimization algorithms available in {PEST}.},

	abstract = {Despite a long history of related research, quantifying and verifying recharge is still a major challenge. The combination and comparison of conceptually different methods has been recommended as a strategy for evaluating recharge estimates. In this article, recharge estimates from water-table fluctuation ({WTF}) methods are combined with and compared to the results of the spatially and temporally discretized soil-water-balance model {PROMET} (processes of radiation, mass and energy transfer). As {PROMET} and {WTF} methods rely on different measurable variables, a comparison of these two contrasting techniques allows improved assessment of the plausibility of recharge estimates. An enhanced approach to {WTF} methods is presented. The approach assumes that in the case of no recharge, there exists a maximum possible potential decline for any given groundwater level. The primary conclusion is that {WTF} methods are excellent for determining the plausibility of spatially distributed regional-groundwater-recharge estimation approaches and for detecting inconsistencies in available models. Recharge estimates derived from {WTF} approaches alone are, however, not suitable for regional-scale recharge estimation due to (1) their strong dependency on local data, applicability of which is limited to only very specific conditions, and (2) their sensitivity to influences other than recharge.},

	title = {The spatial and temporal variability of groundwater recharge within the Trout Lake basin of northern Wisconsin},
	abstract = {Recharge is one of the most difficult, complex, uncertain, and important hydrologic parameters to quantify in the evaluation of groundwater resources. Consequently, quantifying recharge, and its temporal and spatial variability, is one of the leading problems in hydrologic research and is important for groundwater resource evaluation, water quality protection, streamflow management, groundwater flow modeling, and contaminant transport. Four different field-based methods, which utilize soil moisture, water level, streamflow, and baseflow data, and three modeling approaches (an analytic element model, a terrestrial biosphere model, and a soil water balance model) were used to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of natural recharge in the Trout Lake basin of northern Wisconsin for 1996-2000. The results of the different techniques exhibited similar recharge values and distributions, although each approach had its strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. The purpose of the analysis, the type of data available, and the required space and time scales should dictate the recharge method selected. The field measurements and model simulations showed that recharge varies both spatially and temporally within the basin, enough to have implications for water resource management and ecological analyses. Temporal recharge variability is governed by the amount, timing, and type of precipitation, the soil moisture, the thickness of the unsaturated zone, the sediment type, and the land cover. For the five years assessed (1996-2000), monthly recharge rates varied from 0 to 21.3 cm/month, and annual recharge estimates varied almost three-fold. Intra-annually, recharge was limited in the basin to a few isolated events each year and exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern, with the spring snowmelt event constituting the single largest recharge event each year and minor recharge associated with spring and/or late fall rains. Recharge also varied spatially, by as much as 18 cm per year. Spatial recharge variability is due to variability in land cover, soil type, topography, and climate. Vegetation was shown to be the strongest control on the spatial recharge distribution in this basin.* *This dissertation is compound (contains both a paper copy and {CD} as part of the dissertation).

These "corrected" estimates were obtained using site-specific information including wind speed, shelter-height air temperature, gage height, and sheltering. Wind speed and air temperature were interpolated at stations for which these data were not available using a spherically-based, nearest neighbor interpolation procedure. Results indicate that, as expected, biases are greater in the winter than the summer owing to the increased problems (particularly wind-induced) of measuring snowfall. In summer, percent errors range between 4 and 6 percent over nearly three-quarters of the United States with slightly larger errors over the Rocky Mountains. By contrast, winter biases are highly correlated with snowfall totals and percentage errors increase poleward, mimicking patterns of snowfall frequency. Since these biases are not trivial, they must be accounted for in order to obtain accurate and reliable time-series. If these biases are not properly addressed, serious errors can be introduced into climate change, hydrologic modeling, and environmental impact research.},

	abstract = {The impact of preferential flow on recharge and contaminant transport poses a considerable challenge to water-resources management. Typical hydrologic models require extensive site characterization, but can underestimate fluxes when preferential flow is significant. A recently developed source-responsive model incorporates film-flow theory with conservation of mass to estimate unsaturated-zone preferential fluxes with readily available data. The term source-responsive describes the sensitivity of preferential flow in response to water availability at the source of input. We present the first rigorous tests of a parsimonious formulation for simulating water table fluctuations using two case studies, both in arid regions with thick unsaturated zones of fractured volcanic rock. Diffuse flow theory cannot adequately capture the observed water table responses at both sites; the source-responsive model is a viable alternative. We treat the active area fraction of preferential flow paths as a scaled function of water inputs at the land surface then calibrate the macropore density to fit observed water table rises. Unlike previous applications, we allow the characteristic film-flow velocity to vary, reflecting the lag time between source and deep water table responses. Analysis of model performance and parameter sensitivity for the two case studies underscores the importance of identifying thresholds for initiation of film flow in unsaturated rocks, and suggests that this parsimonious approach is potentially of great practical value.},

	abstract = {Rivers in watersheds dominated by agriculture throughout the {US} are impaired by excess sediment, a significant portion of which comes from non-field, near-channel sources. Both land-use and climate have been implicated in altering river flows and thereby increasing stream-channel erosion and sediment loading. In the wetland-rich landscapes of the upper Mississippi basin, 20th century crop conversions have led to an intensification of artificial drainage, which is now a critical component of modern agriculture. At the same time, much of the region has experienced increased annual rainfall. Uncertainty in separating these drivers of streamflow fuels debate between agricultural and environmental interests on responsibility and solutions for excess riverine sediment. To disentangle the effects of climate and land-use, we compared changes in precipitation, crop conversions, and extent of drained depressional area in 21 Minnesota watersheds over the past 70 years. Watersheds with large land-use changes had increases in seasonal and annual water yields of {\textgreater}50\% since 1940. On average, changes in precipitation and crop evapotranspiration explained less than one-half of the increase, with the remainder highly correlated with artificial drainage and loss of depressional areas. Rivers with increased flow have experienced channel widening of 10–40\% highlighting a source of sediment seldom addressed by agricultural best management practices.

	abstract = {In the southeastern Holstein region, located to the east of the metropolitan zone of Hamburg, northern Germany, a groundwater investigation program was conducted from 1984 to 2000 by the State Agency for Nature and Environment (Landesamt für Natur und Umwelt, {LANU}) of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, with the aim of providing long-term, ecologically acceptable groundwater management plans for the region. The focal point of the investigation comprised the determination of groundwater recharge rates. The investigation method was based on the transfer of available lysimeter results from other regions to comparable regions within the area studied. With the help of lysimeter equations, potential amounts of percolation water were calculated. The groundwater recharge rate was then determined after subtraction of the surface runoff which was calculated for the entire area. All computations were performed with a spreadsheet program. Groundwater recharge rates were calculated for two areas. One consisted of roughly determining groundwater recharge rates for the total region (1,392 km 2 ) of southeastern Holstein. The overall goal of these investigations was to identify potential areas of water exploitation. Areas in which groundwater recharge rates are high and groundwater outflow is low are particularly suited to water exploitation, since inflow rates into deeper aquifers are high. These areas are located on the flanks of the Elbe and Stecknitz River valleys. Subsurface groundwater runoff to these lowlands would be reduced through groundwater withdrawal. However, the resulting decline in shallow groundwater tables would be so small that it would have no detrimental ecological effects. Groundwater recharge rates were also calculated for a 110-km 2 area in the outskirts of Hamburg (Grosshansdorf model area) which is intensively developed for water supply. These investigations showed that the amount of groundwater recharge is already being withdrawn to a large extent. Approximately 65\% of the recharge rate is currently withdrawn by the waterworks in this area, thus making further increases in exploitation rates unjustifiable from an ecological point of view.},

Approximately 8 percent of the data sets calculated {AET} in error. Errors were detected in months when estimated {AET} was greater than potential evapotranspiration. Annual climate variability led to errors in accrued soil water storage, which led to errors in the calculation of {AET}. Two hydrologically justifiable modifications were made to correct errors resulting from the use of the original coded Thornthwaite model. The first modification allows for soil water accumulation throughout the year, whereas the second allows for oversaturated soil conditions in the spring. The modified program appears to be robust for any temperate climate condition.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of runoff curve numbers ({CNs}) is unknown, and empirical evidence has suggested that with the current {CN} table, hydrological systems are being over designed—which some believe is due to a variable known as the initial abstraction coefficient (lambda). Therefore, guidelines to produce a new {CN} table are needed. In order to develop this set of guidelines, the following objectives were met: Determination of {CN} and lambda sensitivity, assessment of the accuracy of alternative methods for determining {CNs}, examination of the effect of the range of data, and evaluation of the potential change in hydrologic design due to a new table. Using measured and simulated data, the methods of estimating the {CN} were evaluated and assessed for accuracy. A new method using concepts of lognormal frequency was developed and found to be more accurate than the current practices. It was also found that lambda is an insensitive variable when compared to the {CN}, and therefore, may complicate the optimal fitting of the {CNs}. Finally, it was determined that developing a new {CN} table would affect the estimation of peak discharge rates, and thus hydrologic designs. Therefore, it may be advantageous to develop a new {CN} table based on peak discharge measurements rather than depths of rainfall and runoff. Guidelines that should lead to a revised {CN} model with improved accuracy are provided.},

model is applied to the Little Washita watershed in Central Oklahoma, {USA} and compared
to runoff, soil moisture and energy flux observations. The connection between
groundwater dynamics and the land surface energy balance is studied using a variety of
conventional and spatial statistical measures. For a number of energy variables a strong
interconnection is demonstrated with water table depth. This connection varies seasonally
and spatially depending on the spatial composition of water table depth. A theoretical
critical water table depth range is presented where a strong sensitivity between
groundwater and land-surface processes may be observed. For this particular watershed, a
critical depth range is established between 1 and 5 m in which the land surface energy
budget is most sensitive to groundwater storage. Finally, concrete recommendations are
put forth to characterize this interconnection in the field.},

The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the {JFNK} method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. {JFNK} has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place {JFNK} in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems ({BVPs}) and initial value problems ({IVPs}). We provide an overview of the mechanics of {JFNK} and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that {JFNK} can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of {JFNK}, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how {JFNK} may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information.},

	abstract = {The exchange of heat across the air-water interface is one of the more important factors that govern the temperature of a water body. The net rate of heat exchange at the water surface is the sum of the rates at which heat is transferred by radiative processes, by evaporation, and by conduction between water and overlying air. The net rate can be evaluated in terms of a thermal exchange coefficient and an equilibrium temperature, both of which depend on observable meteorological variables. Any one of the many evaporation formulas and mathematical descriptions of the other heat exchange processes may be used to develop equations involving the thermal exchange coefficient and equilibrium temperature. Such equations are useful in developing relations that describe the temporal and spatial temperature distributions within a water body. They provide additional insight into the effects of meteorological conditions on water temperatures, and they facilitate estimates of various terms of the heat budget.},

	abstract = {The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number ({SCS}-{CN}) method is a widely used empirical rainfall-runoff equation. Although the physical basis of the method has been debated, several researchers have suggested that it can be used to predict the watershed fraction that is saturated and generating runoff by saturation excess from variable source areas ({VSAs}). In this paper, we compare saturated runoff-contributing areas predicted with the {VSA} interpretation of the {SCS}-{CN} method with field-measured {VSAs} in a 0.5 ha hillslope in central New York State. We installed a trench below a {VSA} and simultaneously recorded water flux from different soil layers at the trench face and water table dynamics upslope of the trench. This setup allowed us to monitor runoff initiation and saturation-excess overland flow in response to rainfall and different water table depths in the hillslope during 16 storm events. We found that the {SCS}-{CN} method accurately predicted the observed {VSA} and showed best agreement if the {VSA} was defined as the area where the water table was within 10 cm of the soil surface. These results not only demonstrate that the {VSA} interpretation of the {SCS}-{CN} method accurately predicts {VSA} extents in small watersheds but also that the transient water table does not necessarily need to intersect the land surface to cause a storm runoff response.},

With this budget, using minimal daily-weather input data and the soil-plant-water system-analysis methodology, we were able to characterize the spatial distribution of the hydrologic components of the water balance within the basin. A combination of classification and meteorological methods resulted in a basinwide integration methodology. Using this methodology, we found that, in addition to obvious climatic controls, soil, vegetation, and land-use factors also exert considerable influence on the water balance of the area. The available-water capacity ({AWC}) of soil profiles plays a dominant role in soil-water-deficit development and deep drainage. Vegetation and dryland or irrigated farming particularly affect the evapotranspiration ({ET}) components, with {ET} from irrigated corn and alfalfa being two to three times that from wheat. Deep drainage from irrigated wheat fields was found to be significantly higher than that from grassland and dryland wheat; deep drainage from alfalfa is practically nonexistent. We demonstrated how vegetation changes may affect components of the hydrologic cycle. We also showed that different portions of the watershed have different water-balance components and that use of single average values of hydrologic variables in management practices may not be realistic.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a model that can reconstruct water table position and soil temperature profiles to 3 m depth in boreal mixed mire systems using the readily available climate data on air temperature and precipitation as driving variables. The model simulates complete, multiple annual cycles including winter conditions and freeze-thaw processes. The major requisite for an accurate description of the soil heat flux in a mire is an accurate description of the water content of the profile because of the high porosity of the soil and the thermal properties of water. The soil moisture profile in this model is described as a function of water table position derived from empirical published data of soil moisture profile measurements at different water table positions. The parameters of the model were set and tested for a lawn community, one of the most dominant plant communities occurring in boreal mixed mires. The model is optimized for the period 1995–1997 at the mixed mire Degerö Stormyr and was validated for the period 1997–1998 at the same location and for 1991–1993 at Storåmyran, 60 km away. The mean deviation of simulated to measured soil temperature from 10 cm to 3 m depth in the validation data sets was {\textless}1.6°C with a maximal standard deviation of 1.8°C. A response analysis of the amount of winter precipitation showed the influence of snow cover depth on soil frost fluctuations. A simulated precipitation corresponding to 25\% of the measured precipitation during winter 1995–1996, with all other factors unchanged, prolonged the period of frozen ground in the model from June 8 to August 1. With a doubling of the winter precipitation the modeled period of frozen ground lasted only until May 6.},

The predictive capability of the model was improved, particularly for the subsoiling tillage case. The simulation results show that temporal changes in soil hydraulic conductivity induced by different tillage practices can affect percolation, water storage, transpiration and evaporation. Differences in the simulated components of the water balance were found to be small between {CT} and {NT} practices, but larger in the {ST} case. Compared with the conventional and no-tillage methods, subsoiling promotes infiltration and deep percolation, thereby favoring a possible recharge of the groundwater. Actual evaporation is always lower in the subsoiled plots, whatever the hydrological year. Transpiration is similar for the three treatments, suggesting no significant differences in water availability, except in wet years where it is higher in subsoiled soils.},

Of the seven evapotranspiration models evaluated, three models calculate actual evapotranspiration directly using the complementary relationship approach, i.e. the {CRAE} model of Morton, the advection-aridity ({AA}) model of Brutsaert and Stricker, and the {GG} model of Granger and Gray, and four models calculate first potential evapotranspiration and then actual evapotranspiration by considering the soil moisture condition. Two of the four potential evapotranspiration models belong to the temperature-based category, i.e. the Thornthwaite model and the Hargreaves model, and the other two belong to the radiation-based category, i.e. the Makkink model and the Priestley-Taylor model. The evapotranspiration calculated by the above seven models, together with precipitation, is used in the water balance model to calculate other water balance components. The results show that, for the calculation of actual evapotranspiration, the {GG} model and the Makkink model performed better than the other models; for the calculation of groundwater recharge using the water balance approach, the {GG} model and the {AA} models performed better; for the simulation of soil moisture content using the water balance approach, four models ({GG}, Thornthwaite, Makkink and Priestley-Taylor) out of the seven give equally good results. It can be concluded that the lysimeter-measured water balance components, i.e. actual evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, soil moisture, etc., can be predicted by the {GG} model and the Makkink model with good accuracy.},

	abstract = {Successful applications of stochastic models for simulating and predicting daily stream temperature have been reported in the literature. These stochastic models have been generally tested on small rivers and have used only air temperature as an exogenous variable. This study investigates the stochastic modelling of daily mean stream water temperatures on the Moisie River, a relatively large unregulated river located in Québec, Canada. The objective of the study is to compare different stochastic approaches previously used on small streams to relate mean daily water temperatures to air temperatures and streamflow indices. Various stochastic approaches are used to model the water temperature residuals, representing short-term variations, which were obtained by subtracting the seasonal components from water temperature time-series. The first three models, a multiple regression, a second-order autoregressive model, and a Box and Jenkins model, used only lagged air temperature residuals as exogenous variables. The root-mean-square error ({RMSE}) for these models varied between 0·53 and 1·70 °C and the second-order autoregressive model provided the best results.A statistical methodology using best subsets regression is proposed to model the combined effect of discharge and air temperature on stream temperatures. Various streamflow indices were considered as additional independent variables, and models with different number of variables were tested. The results indicated that the best model included relative change in flow as the most important streamflow index. The {RMSE} for this model was of the order of 0·51 °C, which shows a small improvement over the first three models that did not include streamflow indices. The ridge regression was applied to this model to alleviate the potential statistical inadequacies associated with multicollinearity. The amplitude and sign of the ridge regression coefficients seem to be more in agreement with prior expectations (e.g. positive correlation between water temperature residuals of different lags) and make more physical sense.

Stream temperatures measured from 23 July to 3 September 1997 were used to calibrate the model, evaluate existing temperatures, generate simulations for different shade conditions and channel morphologies, and generate simulations for “average” and “warm” summers (we define a warm summer as one that is 2.8°C above the 30-year mean). The simulations indicated that successional buffers (grasses and forbs) provided as much shade as wooded buffers in streams with a width less than 2.5 m. With a low width:depth ratio, the successional buffer vegetation mediated mean temperature as well as the wooded buffer when discharge was held constant. At a discharge characteristic of our study reach, the mean temperature would be about the same along a successional buffer as in a wooded buffer if the wooded vegetation also led to widening of the stream channel. However, wooded buffers had a significantly higher percentage of shade than grazed or successional buffers. In general, temperatures in an average year decreased along the wooded reaches and increased slightly along the successional and grazed buffer areas. The differences in measured weekly mean maximum temperatures may be as great as 2.5°C across riparian buffer types. Maximum temperatures across all riparian types would be higher during warmer than average years, even with 50\% shade along the stream. Shade provided by successional and woody vegetation may serve to moderate maximum temperatures and may be sufficient for the reintroduction of brook trout if other conditions improve.},

	abstract = {{AbstractThe} Soil Conservation Service ({SCS}) method is widely used to estimate runoff from small- to medium-sized watersheds. The most critical assumption of the {SCS} method is that the ratio of actual retention to potential retention is the same as the ratio of actual runoff to potential runoff; however, this assumption has not been empirically validated. The paper develops a framework to test this proportionality assumption that underpins the {SCS} method. Using data on rainfall intensity and storm runoff from 210 site events from Australia and Southeast Asian countries, this paper shows that a strong relationship exists between maximum retention on the basis of the {SCS} equation and the product of effective storm duration and spatially averaged maximum infiltration rate, and empirical support exists for the proportionality assumption for runoff estimation. Relating the maximum retention to the effective storm duration and maximum infiltration rate provides additional avenues for prediction of storm runoff amount and peak runoff rate, which are the key design parameters for storm water control and management.},

	abstract = {Environmental and societal factors such as air quality, water quality and availability, land use changes and expanding urbanization are already affecting human health and welfare, agriculture, and natural ecosystems in the Midwestern United States. Over this century, these existing stresses will likely be exacerbated by climate changes resulting from human activities. It is essential that policy decisions aimed at preserving the well-being of a region be informed by a good understanding of the region's climate, how climate might change,and the uncertainties inherent in future projections. Recent updates in climate modeling expertise and an expanded view of possible non-intervention emission scenarios have narrowed the range of change that can be expected over the Midwest throughout the next century in some ways, while broadening it in others. In contrast to previous studies, which generally consider a mid-range scenario for future emissions, this study presents the range of change that would result from low to high scenarios for climate change. In this way we account for uncertainties in anthropogenic forcing on climate change in the region and quantify the potential effects of human actions on future climate. This analysis also combines the latest climate model projections with historical records of observed climate over the past century, effectively placing potential changes in extreme event frequencies such as heavy rainfall events and temperature threshold exceedances within the context of observed variability over the past century.The purpose of this study is to provide an updated picture of the potential impacts of climate change on the Midwest to inform the impact assessment and policy development community. From the magnitude of the changes projected by this study, it is clear that these must be included in future policy decisions in order to ensure the successful adaptation and survival of existing human and natural systems in the Midwest.},

	abstract = {Recharge varies spatially and temporally as it depends on a wide variety of factors (e.g. vegetation, precipitation, climate, topography, geology, and soil type), making it one of the most difficult, complex, and uncertain hydrologic parameters to quantify. Despite its inherent variability, groundwater modellers, planners, and policy makers often ignore recharge variability and assume a single average recharge value for an entire watershed. Relatively few attempts have been made to quantify or incorporate spatial and temporal recharge variability into water resource planning or groundwater modelling efforts. In this study, a simple, daily soil-water balance model was developed and used to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater recharge of the Trout Lake basin of northern Wisconsin for 1996-2000 as a means to quantify recharge variability. For the 5 years of study, annual recharge varied spatially by as much as 18 cm across the basin; vegetation was the predominant control on this variability. Recharge also varied temporally with a threefold annual difference over the 5-year period. Intra-annually, recharge was limited to a few isolated events each year and exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern. The results suggest that ignoring recharge variability may not only be inappropriate, but also, depending on the application, may invalidate model results and predictions for regional and local water budget calculations, water resource management, nutrient cycling, and contaminant transport studies. Recharge is spatially and temporally variable, and should be modelled as such. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Biological, chemical, and physical attributes of aquatic ecosystems are often strongly influenced by groundwater sources. Nonetheless, widespread access to predictions of subsurface contributions to rivers, lakes, and wetlands at a scale useful to environmental managers is generally lacking. In this paper, we describe a “neighborhood analysis” approach for estimating topographic constraints on spatial patterns of recharge and discharge and discuss how this index has proven useful in research, management, and conservation contexts. The Michigan Rivers Inventory subsurface flux model ({MRI}-{DARCY}) used digital elevation and hydraulic conductivity inferred from mapped surficial geology to estimate spatial patterns of hydraulic potential. Model predictions were calculated in units of specific discharge (meters per day) for a 30-m 2 -cell raster map and interpreted as an index of potential subsurface water flux (shallow groundwater and event through-flow). The model was evaluated by comparison with measurements of groundwater-related attributes at watershed, stream segment, and local spatial scales throughout Lower Michigan ({USA}). Map-based predictions using {MRI}-{DARCY} accounted for 85\% of the observed variation in base flow from 128 {USGS} gauges, 69\% of the observed variation in discharge accrual from 48 river segments, and 29\% of the residual variation in local groundwater flux from 33 locations as measured by hyporheic temperature profiles after factoring out the effects of climate. Although it does not incorporate any information about the actual water table surface, by quantifying spatial variation of key constraints on groundwater-related attributes, the model provides strata for more intensive study, as well as a useful spatial tool for regional and local conservation planning, fisheries management, wetland characterization, and stream assessment.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Airborne thermal remote sensing from four flights on a single day from a single-engine airplane was used to collect thermal infrared data of a 10.47-km reach of the upper East Branch Pecatonica River in southwest Wisconsin. The study uses a one-dimensional stream temperature model calibrated with the longitudinal profiles of stream temperature created from the four thermal imaging flights and validated with three days of continuous stream temperature data from instream data loggers on the days surrounding the thermal remote-sensing campaign. Model simulations were used to quantify the sensitivity of stream thermal habitat to increases in air and groundwater temperature and changes in base flow. The simulations indicate that stream temperatures may reach critical maximum thresholds for brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) mortality, particularly if both air temperature increases and base flow declines. The approach demonstrates that thermal infrared data can greatly assist stream temperature model validation due to its high spatial resolution, and that this spatially continuous stream temperature data can be used to pinpoint spatial heterogeneity in groundwater inflow to streams. With this spatially distributed data on thermal heterogeneity and base-flow accretion, stream temperature models considering various climate change scenarios are able to identify thermal refugia that will be critical for fisheries management under a changing climate.},

	volume = {17},
	abstract = {Rapidly depleting unconfined aquifers are the primary source of water for irrigation on the North China Plain. Yet, despite its critical importance, groundwater recharge to the Plain remains an enigma. We introduce a one-dimensional soil-water-balance model to estimate precipitation- and irrigation-generated areal recharge from commonly available crop and soil characteristics and climate data. To limit input data needs and to simplify calculations, the model assumes that water flows vertically downward under a unit gradient; infiltration and evapotranspiration are separate, sequential processes; evapotranspiration is allocated to evaporation and transpiration as a function of leaf-area index and is limited by soil-moisture content; and evaporation and transpiration are distributed through the soil profile as exponential functions of soil and root depth, respectively. For calibration, model-calculated water contents of 11 soil-depth intervals from 0 to 200 cm were compared with measured water contents of loam soil at four sites in Luancheng County, Hebei Province, over 3 years (1998-2001). Each 50-m2 site was identically cropped with winter wheat and summer maize, but received a different irrigation treatment. Average root mean-squared error between measured and model-calculated water content of the top 180 cm was 4·2 cm, or 9·3\% of average total water content. In addition, model-calculated evapotranspiration compared well with that measured by a large-scale lysimeter. To test the model, 12 additional sites were simulated successfully. Model results demonstrate that drainage from the soil profile is not a constant fraction of precipitation and irrigation inputs, but rather the fraction increases as the inputs increase. Because this drainage recharges the underlying aquifer, improving irrigation efficiency by reducing seepage will not reverse water-table declines.},

There is still not an adequate physical theory linking all types of flow, and there are still not adequate observational techniques to support the scale dependent parameterizations that will be required at practical field and hillslope scales of application.

	abstract = {Maximum daily stream water temperature information is very important when assessing fish habitat in terms of distribution and fish growth rate. For instance, coldwater fishes such as the Atlantic salmon can be adversely affected by these maximum summer temperatures or by those exacerbated by land use practices such as deforestation. The present study deals with the modelling of maximum daily stream water temperatures using regression and stochastic models to relate air and water temperatures in Catamaran Brook, a small stream in New Brunswick where long-term multidisciplinary habitat research is being carried out. The regression model was a logistic type function while the stochastic model was based on the autocorrelation structure of the water temperature time series. The first step in the stochastic modelling was to establish the long-term annual component in stream water temperatures. This was possible by fitting a combination of a Fourier and Sine function to stream water temperatures. The short-term residual temperatures (departure from the long-term annual component) were modelled using a second order Markov process. Results showed that the regression type model was only possible on a weekly basis with a root-mean-square error ({RMSE}) of 1.93°C. Alternatively, the stochastic model showed that it was possible to predict maximum daily water temperatures for small streams using air temperatures only. The {RMSE} varied between 1.48 and 1.62°C on an annual basis from 1992 to 1997, which were lower than the regression model. Calibrations were carried out on a seasonal basis as well as during the summer of each year. However, the improvements in the modelling were less than 0.1°C. It was also noted that the empirical coefficient linking air to water temperatures residuals varied on a seasonal and summer basis, and this coefficient was related to summer discharge. Although variable, this empirical coefficient did not improve the modelling significantly on a seasonal or summer basis.},

	abstract = {Summary
A statistical bias correction methodology for global climate simulations is developed and applied to daily land precipitation and mean, minimum and maximum daily land temperatures. The bias correction is based on a fitted histogram equalization function. This function is defined daily, as opposed to earlier published versions in which they were derived yearly or seasonally at best, while conserving properties of robustness and eliminating unrealistic jumps at seasonal or monthly transitions. The methodology is tested using the newly available global dataset of observed hydrological forcing data of the last 50 years from the {EU} project {WATCH} ({WATer} and global {CHange}) and an initial conditions ensemble of simulations performed with the {ECHAM}5 global climate model for the same period. Bias corrections are derived from 1960 to 1969 observed and simulated data and then applied to 1990–1999 simulations. Results confirm the effectiveness of the methodology for all tested variables. Bias corrections are also derived using three other non-overlapping decades from 1970 to 1999 and all members of the {ECHAM}5 initial conditions ensemble. A methodology is proposed to use the resulting “ensemble of bias corrections” to quantify the error in simulated scenario projections of components of the hydrological cycle.},

The method uses a digital terrain model ({DTM}) of the area and regionalised climate data to derive the soil regionalised variables that form the basis of the prediction. The method was tested using 94 soil profile samples in the Quaternary stratum of the Schatterbach test site, a 2387 ha investigation area in the Bavarian Tertiary Hills (Germany). The approach is based on the assumption that the shape of the landscape and the late Quaternary climate history determines slope development and soil forming processes. To develop the method, a suite of terrain- indices and complex process parameters was derived from {DTM} and climate data. Step-wise linear regression was then used to identify which of these terrain indices and process parameters were most useful in predicting the required soil attributes. Testing of the approach showed that 88.1\% of the variance was explained by a combination of the sediment transport, mass balance and solifluction parameters, providing a sound basis for the prediction of soil parameters in hilly terrain.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Natural Resources Conservation Service ({NRCS}) [previously Soil Conservation Service ({SCS})] developed the {SCS} runoff curve-number ({CN}) method for estimating direct runoff from storm rainfall. The {NRCS} uses the {CN} method for designing structures and for evaluating their effectiveness. Structural design is usually based on a single event of a certain probability of occurrence. During the years when many floodwater-retarding watershed projects were planned and constructed (1950–1980), the {CN} equation was used in a continuous mode to evaluate the projects. To operate {CN} in a continuous mode, runoff was estimated from a daily rainfall record of approximately 30 years. For each day of recorded rainfall, the five-day antecedent rainfall was used to assign a (dry condition), (average condition), or (wet condition), and runoff was estimated with the appropriate {CN}. With the development of continuous hydrologic simulation models, {CN} was related directly to soil water content or estimated using rainfall and potential evapotranspiration ({PET}) to drive an index. Several methods were attempted and used with different degrees of success over a period of many years. The purpose of this study is to describe the evolution of the continuous {CN} method and its recent developments. Test results on the basis of the direct-link soil-moisture approach and the revised soil-moisture index method are presented for demonstration purposes. The results indicate that the revised soil-moisture index method is robust and produces realistic runoff estimates over a wide range of soil properties.},

By using the simple non-linear storage based model, first proposed by Horton, an analytical solution of the overland flow equations over a plane hillslope was derived. This solution establishes a generalization for different flow regimes of Horton's original solution, which is valid for the transitional flow regime only. The solution proposed was compared successfully with that of Horton and, for the turbulent flow regime, to the one derived from kinematic wave theory. This solution can be applied easily to both stationary and non-stationary rainfall excess events. An analytical solution for the instantaneous response function ({IRF}) was also derived. Finally, simple expressions to compute peak and time to peak of {IRF} are proposed. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {{AbstractRadar}-derived next generation weather radar ({NEXRAD}) process 3 (P3) data offer high spatial resolution precipitation data that might improve stream-flow simulation accuracy using watershed models. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of spatially averaged subwatershed-specific P3 data on stream-flow simulations by using the soil and water assessment tool ({SWAT}) hydrologic model. This study was the first to evaluate the P3 product in watershed modeling. The {SWAT} model was chosen to simulate hydrological processes in North Fork Ninnescah Watershed (2,400 km2) located in south central Kansas. A precipitation gauge ({PG}) station was created for each subwatershed by using an area-weighted average of P3 precipitation estimates for all 16-km2 grid cells intersecting the subwatershed. Average subwatershed area (19 km2) was selected to correspond roughly with {NEXRAD} cell area to minimize spatial aggregation of radar precipitation data. The {SWAT} model was calibrated with both P3 data and {PG} data from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2008. The P3-calibrated model was validated by using both different precipitation source data for the same simulation period (2002–2008) and the same source data with an independent simulation period (1996–2001). The {PG}-calibrated model yielded slightly higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ({ENS}), both daily (0.40) and monthly (0.60), than the P3-calibrated model (daily: 0.35, monthly: 0.52); percent bias was very good ({\textless}±2\%) for both P3- and {PG}-calibrated models at all time scales. Validation {ENS} results, however, were diminished using {PG} data with the P3-calibrated model (daily: 0.27, monthly: 0.52) but remained similar using P3 data with the {PG}-calibrated model (daily: 0.40, monthly: 0.52). The {PG} data appeared to demonstrate variable uncertainty among stations that was not evident for the P3 data, providing incentive for the use of P3 data. This study found evidence that the {SWAT} model, when run using more spatially representative precipitation data (in this case, P3), was less sensitive to minor variations in model calibration parameters. On the basis of this initial assessment of P3 data for hydrologic modeling, bias adjustment to reduce the effect of a small number of extreme P3 precipitation values may have improved results but was not required to produce watershed-outlet stream flow results similar to using {PG} data in this study.},

	abstract = {The Versatile Soil Moisture Budget ({VSMB}), including the background leading to its development in the “early days” meaning around 30 yr ago, is described. National and international efforts before that time created a healthy climate for the development of agrometeorology in Canada and the pioneering work in soil moisture and crop-weather modelling. Events in the early days leading to a concerted endeavour of soil moisture modelling included: (i) a small group of highly qualified professionals from different disciplines, as well as support staff, had been established under the guidance of a team leader at the then Plant Research Institute ({PRI}); ii) a Canada wide crop-weather study had produced daily climatological and crop data at nine Canada Department of Agriculture establishments over 10 yr (1953–1962); iii) a computer became available to {PRI} staff ({IBM} 1620 with 16K); and (v) several sub-models providing the necessary input to the soil moisture model were at various stages of development (e.g. the “latent” evaporation and the biometeorological time scale sub-models). This paper presents an overview of the development of the {VSMB} using standard climatological data for generating daily soil moisture estimates under crops. Its concept, design and widespread applications in Canada and abroad are discussed. A more detailed analysis is left to the other presentations at this Symposium.},

	abstract = {The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number ({SCS}-{CN}) method is widely used in determination of direct surface run-off in long-term (continuous) hydrologic simulation models. Of late, Michel et al. (2005) reviewed the soil moisture accounting ({SMA}) procedure that lies behind the original {SCS}-{CN} method and pointed out severe structural inconsistencies in the treatment of antecedent condition and, in turn, proposed a sounder methodology. However, this method still needs refinement in the definition of initial moisture level (V0) to make it usable in field. Thus, in the present study, the Michel et al. (2005) model is modified to avoid the unrealistic sudden jump in V0 by incorporating conceptual {SMA} procedure and variation of daily {CN} based on antecedent moisture amount instead of antecedent moisture condition. When applied to 17 watersheds from different agro-climatic regions of India, the proposed model simulates daily stream flows better than those due to Michel et al. model. The proposed model performed better in high run-off producing (wet) watersheds than in low run-off producing (dry) watersheds, and the base flow was more and less significant in high and low run-off producing watersheds, respectively, whereas the evapotranspiration showed a reverse trend.

	abstract = {Discharge in many rivers is often fed by outflow from a shallow groundwater reservoir. It is becoming clear that the outflow from this aquifer is not linearly proportional to storage as is commonly assumed in many algorithms. Numerical analysis of flow recession curves from about 100 river gauging stations instead reveals a nonlinear relationship between baseflow, Q, and storage, S, for which the equation S={aQb} was adopted. Values of the exponent b are found by calibration to be between 0 and 1 but with a high concentration around 0·5, which is in accordance with the findings of other studies and theoretical approaches yielding b=0·5 for unconfined aquifers and relating the coefficient a to catchment properties, primarily area and shape of basin, pore volume and transmissivity. This non-linear reservoir function is proposed as a more realistic alternative to the linear reservoir function.The relatively fast response of groundwater flow to rainfall is mainly a result of the increase of hydraulic head of the groundwater reservoir accelerating the exfiltration of ‘old’, pre-event water into the river bed. As fissure and pore volumes communicate hydraulically, it appears physically reasonable to model the system by one non-linear reservoir for catchments, or parts of them, instead of applying independent parallel linear reservoirs. The non-linear reservoir algorithms are supported by an analytical derivation. They are extended for the automatic separation of baseflow from a time-series of daily discharge in rivers and the computation of storage and effective recharge of groundwater in river basins by inverse nonlinear reservoir routing. The time-series obtained allow the identification and quantification of long-term changes to the water balance. Relationships between computed groundwater storage and observed groundwater level can also be established. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Salinization of soil is a major problem in arid and semi-arid regions with saline shallow water table. This is influenced by climate, soil type, crop, irrigation water quality and management practice, depth to water table, and salinity of the water table. Modelling can be used for estimating capillary rise and salinity of soil profile with saline shallow water table. The objective of this study was to modify a transient state analytical model ({TSAM}) for estimating capillary rise and salinity of soil profile with different saline water table depths and salinities under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions in a micro-lysimeter. In the modified {TSAM} variable root depth, non-uniform water uptake pattern and a more complete water balance equation were included. Modified {TSAM} resulted in good agreement between measured and estimated cumulative and weekly capillary rise for wheat experiment. Furthermore, this modified model predicted the capillary rise and salinity of different soil layers for various water table depths (0.3–1.20 m) and salinity levels (0.5–13.0 {dS} m−1) under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions accurately. However, the prediction accuracy of capillary rise for a highly saline water table (13.0 {dS} m−1) and shallow water table depth (smaller than 0.6 m) was rather poor. This might has been occurred due to the effects of high soil salinity in the root zone on the roots water uptake reduction. Furthermore, the modified {TSAM} responded accurately to both irrigated and non-irrigated conditions. When the application of the numerical models to larger irrigation areas with varying soil types, depth to water table and agronomic practice may not be feasible, the modified {TSAM} may be suitable for estimating short-term mean rate of capillary rise, net long-term capillary rise and season soil salinities in different soil layers.},

	abstract = {Estimating groundwater recharge is a key component in determining the sustainable yield of groundwater resources in arid and semi-arid areas such as southern California. Estimating groundwater recharge on a regional scale requires developing a water budget that incorporates data on boundary conditions, aquifer properties, groundwater levels, and groundwater production. The hydrological budget method proposed herein is simple, cost-effective, and easy to apply. It utilizes matched pairs of groundwater level measurements, groundwater extraction data, and distributed specific yield information for estimating groundwater recharge. In this method, {ARCGIS} 9.0 Geostatistical and Spatial Analyst applications are used for interpolating/extrapolating and creating grids for specific yield, bedrock elevation, and raw groundwater data. The annual average groundwater recharge for the Hemet subbasin in western Riverside County, California, from 1997 to 2005 is estimated at 12.5 {MCM}, with wet and dry periods ranging between 14.9 {MCM} and 11.7 {MCM}, respectively. The proposed method utilizes information commonly available to most groundwater management entities, such as groundwater production data, groundwater level measurements, and lithologic information.},

In order to develop the spatio-temporal estimates of aquifer recharge and to analyze to what extent urban growth has affected aquifer recharge, this work presents a daily soil water balance which uses different vegetation and soil types as well as the effect of topography on climatological variables and evapotranspiration. The soil water balance was applied on a daily time step in the Basin of Mexico for the period 1975–1986, obtaining an annually-lumped potential recharge flow of 10.9–23.8 m3/s (35.9–78.1 mm) in the entire Basin, while the monthly values for the year with the largest lumped recharge value (1981 = 78.1 mm) range from 1 m3/s (0.3 mm) in December to 87.9 m3/s (23.7 mm) in June. As aquifer recharge in the Basin mainly occurs by subsurface flow from its enclosing mountains as Mountain Block Recharge, urban growth has had a minimal impact on aquifer recharge, although it has diminished recharge in the alluvial plain.},

	abstract = {{AbstractThe} Natural Resources Conservation Service ({NRCS}) [previously Soil Conservation Service ({SCS})] developed the {SCS} runoff curve-number ({CN}) method for estimating direct runoff from storm rainfall. The {NRCS} uses the {CN} method for designing structures and for evaluating their effectiveness. Structural design is usually based on a single event of a certain probability of occurrence. During the years when many floodwater-retarding watershed projects were planned and constructed (1950–1980), the {CN} equation was used in a continuous mode to evaluate the projects. To operate {CN} in a continuous mode, runoff was estimated from a daily rainfall record of approximately 30 years. For each day of recorded rainfall, the five-day antecedent rainfall was used to assign a {CN}1 (dry condition), {CN}2 (average condition), or {CN}3 (wet condition), and runoff was estimated with the appropriate {CN}. With the development of continuous hydrologic simulation models, {CN} was related directly to soil water content or estimated using rainfall and potential evapotranspiration ({PET}) to drive an index. Several methods were attempted and used with different degrees of success over a period of many years. The purpose of this study is to describe the evolution of the continuous {CN} method and its recent developments. Test results on the basis of the direct-link soil-moisture approach and the revised soil-moisture index method are presented for demonstration purposes. The results indicate that the revised soil-moisture index method is robust and produces realistic runoff estimates over a wide range of soil properties.},

We propose a simple system, using a capacitive hygrometer and alternate sampling of air at two levels with pumps to measure humidity gradients. It is well adapted to long-term measurements: low power consumption, low charge of maintenance, and low cost. It has been tested by comparison of hourly sensible and latent heat flux measurements performed by both eddy correlation and Bowen ratio, over a bare soil field and a fully evaporating canopy. Results are satisfactory over a large range of fluxes (0–400 W m−2) under daytime conditions. The main sources and magnitude of errors were investigated under the contrasted situations of bare soil and fully evaporating canopy. The system was shown to give good flux estimates even with very low humidity gradients.},

	abstract = {Air quality models are used to make decisions regarding the construction of industrial plants, the types of fuel that will be burnt and the types of pollution control devices that will be used. It is important to know the uncertainties that are associated with these model predictions. Standard analytical methods found in elementary statistics textbooks for estimating uncertainties are generally not applicable since the distributions of performance measures related to air quality concentrations are not easily transformed to a Gaussian shape. This paper suggests several possible resampling procedures that can be used to calculate uncertainties or confidence limits on air quality model performance. In these resampling methods, many new data sets are drawn from the original data set using an empirical set of rules. A few alternate forms of the socalled bootstrap and jackknife resampling procedures are tested using a concocted data set with a Gaussian parent distributions, with the result that the jackknife is the most efficient procedure to apply, although its confidence bounds are slightly overestimated. The resampling procedures are then applied to predictions by seven air quality models for the Carpinteria coastal dispersion experiment. Confidence intervals on the fractional mean bias and the normalized mean square error are calculated for each model and for differences between models. It is concluded that these uncertainties are sometimes so large for data sets consisting of about 20 elements that it cannot be stated with 95\% confidence that the performance measure for the ‘best’ model is significantly different from that for another model.},

It considers the variety and reliability of measurement techniques that have been used and interprets the results of interception studies in relation to methodological, vegetational and climatic factors. The review illustrates that it is difficult to draw general conclusions about interception losses by particular forest types because they almost always depend on the type of rainfall and other meteorological conditions during the study period. Characteristics of a forest that affect interception are not always easy to identify and quantify. Characteristics such as trees/ha, branch angle, the uniformity or lack of uniformity in crown height, the nature and thickness of the bark layer, leaf shape and inclination, and leaf area index will all influence interception. The major difficulty is reliable estimation of throughfall. It is not unusual for measured throughfall to exceed the rainfall value, causing interception to be negative. The difficulty in estimation of throughfall is discussed, while also addressing the need for accurate measurement of rainfall. In forests where stemflow volumes are large enough to significantly influence the interception values, the methodological approach is even more difficult. Measurement of interception on a periodic basis presents fewer problems than estimation on an individual event basis because the variables that affect the values of throughfall and stemflow can change over very short periods, for example the intensity and angle of rainfall, and wind speed and direction. However, carefully conducted event-based studies can quantify the influence of a number of the variables. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the development of an integrated saturated/unsaturated catchment model of salinity processes and its application to an irrigated and dryland district in northern Victoria, Australia. The model simulates a coupled surface water and groundwater system in which a lumped conceptual model is used to model one-dimensional movement through the unsaturated zone, and a distributed model is used to simulate three-dimensional saturated groundwater flow. Movement of water through the unsaturated zone was found to be dominated by macropore flow, and accordingly the classical matrix flow approximations described by the Richards equation were not used. Instead, a conceptual model of the unsaturated zone was developed to simulate soil infiltration, recharge to the underlying groundwater system, capillary rise and crop evaporation on a daily time-step for each active cell within the model domain. Subsurface lateral flow between each vertical soil column is not permitted, though once in the saturated zone lateral flows are handled by the groundwater model. Salt movement through the profile is simulated using a mass balance approach, and separate conceptual formulations are used to generate salt export along the drainage lines.

Because most implicit models and objective functions are very difficult as regards analytical solution or for finding high-order derivatives, a numerical analysis method is developed which not only can assess the identifiability problem but also can provide useful information for dealing with parameter optimization. The major studies involved are two-fold: (1) proposing a mathematical description and assessment method for the structural identifiability of hydrological models; and (2) providing a workable and robust identification technique using a rotating transformation of the parameter space. Using both generated error-free and watershed data in China, it has been verified that the approach is of significance and usefulness.},

	abstract = {Most runoff simulation and infiltration models have been developed at the global-catchment scale or the local-soil column scale. Few models have been specifically developed at the scale of agricultural fields and there are no guidelines to help modellers choose an adequate model to simulate overland flow and hence analyse the impact of different soil management practices on flood generation. A comparison is undertaken to select and calibrate models that simulate Hortonian overland flow at the field or small plot scale. The proposed methodology couples a runoff production model to a unit hydrograph transfer function. Four different models were tested: Philip, Morel-Seytoux, Horton and {SCS}. These models differ by their mathematical structure and the parameters to be calibrated while input hydrologic data are the same site data: rainfall/runoff and initial water content. The models are calibrated on 14 events and validated on 14 others. The results of both the calibration and validation phases are compared on the basis of their performance with regards to six objective criteria, three global criteria and three relative criteria representing volume, peakflow, and the root mean square error. The first type of criteria gives more weight to strong events whereas the second considers all events to be of equal weight. The results show that the calibrated parameter values are dependent on the type of objective criteria used. Furthermore, when analysing the performance of the six objective criteria used, it can be seen that the global volume, global {RMSE} and relative peakflow criteria give the best compromise between bias and precision. Within the selected modelling framework, Morel-Seytoux's model performed better than the other three and the {SCS} gave the worst results. Horton's model showed to be more consistent in overall performance than Philip's model. Results also highlight problems related to the simulation of low flow events and intermittent rainfall events.},

The value of 27 {PE} models was assessed in terms of streamflow simulation efficiency over a large sample of 308 catchments located in France, Australia and the United States. While trying to identify which atmospheric variables were the most relevant to compute {PE} as input to rainfall–runoff models, we showed that the formulae based on temperature and radiation tend to provide the best streamflow simulations. Surprisingly, {PE} approaches based on the Penman approach seem less advantageous to feed rainfall–runoff models. This investigation has resulted in a proposal for a temperature-based {PE} model, combining simplicity and efficiency, and adapted to four rainfall–runoff models. This {PE} model only requires mean air temperature (derived from long-term averages) and leads to a slight but steady improvement in rainfall–runoff model efficiency.},

The modelling results show the ability of this modelling system to simulate water balance and crop growth with acceptable precision. Additionally, the impact of a recombination of the two simulation model components on the simulations of the field data was analyzed. These recombinations include an exchange of the soil water balance modules, the crop-growth models and the formulae for calculating potential evapotranspiration. This analysis indicates that the type of soil water model used is the most essential consideration for simulating the dynamics of soil water contents and percolation. The exchange of crop models and the use of different modules for calculating potential evapotranspiration affect evaporation, transpiration and interception. The impact of these rearrangements on soil water dynamics was less significant than the effects from the different soil water models.},

A five-parameter M3 model is proposed, with storm duration and a new parameter Sabs (potential maximum retention), to overcome most of the above limitations prevailing in the {SCS}-{CN} model. For simplicity and practical applications obviating storm-duration data, a four-parameter M4 model is also proposed. The performance of the suggested and the available models has been evaluated using the data of 82 small watersheds in the United States of America.

	abstract = {A method for generating daily surfaces of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and radiation over large regions of complex terrain is presented. Required inputs include digital elevation data and observations of maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation from ground-based meteorological stations. Our method is based on the spatial convolution of a truncated Gaussian weighting filter with the set of station locations. Sensitivity to the typical heterogeneous distribution of stations in complex terrain is accomplished with an iterative station density algorithm. Spatially and temporally explicit empirical analyses of the relationships of temperature and precipitation to elevation were performed, and the characteristic spatial and temporal scales of these relationships were explored. A daily precipitation occurrence algorithm is introduced, as a precursor to the prediction of daily precipitation amount. Surfaces of humidity (vapor pressure deficit) are generated as a function of the predicted daily minimum temperature and the predicted daily average daylight temperature. Daily surfaces of incident solar radiation are generated as a function of Sun-slope geometry and interpolated diurnal temperature range. The application of these methods is demonstrated over an area of approximately 400 000 detailed illustration of the parameterization process. A cross-validation analysis was performed, comparing predicted and observed daily and annual average values. Mean absolute errors ({MAE}) for predicted annual average maximum and minimum temperature were 0.7°C and 1.2°C, with biases of +0.1°C and −0.1°C, respectively. {MAE} for predicted annual total precipitation was 13.4 cm, or, expressed as a percentage of the observed annual totals, 19.3\%. The success rate for predictions of daily precipitation occurrence was 83.3\%. Particular attention was given to the predicted and observed relationships between precipitation frequency and intensity, and they were shown to be similar. We tested the sensitivity of these methods to prediction grid-point spacing, and found that areal averages were unchanged for grids ranging in spacing from 500 m to 32 km. We tested the dependence of the results on timestep, and found that the temperature prediction algorithms scale perfectly in this respect. Temporal scaling of precipitation predictions was complicated by the daily occurrence predictions, but very nearly the same predictions were obtained at daily and annual timesteps.},

	title = {Numerically optimized empirical modeling of highly dynamic, spatially expansive, and behaviorally heterogeneous hydrologic systems—Part 1},
	abstract = {Natural systems exhibit random, chaotic, and multiply periodic behaviors that are driven by gravity, weather, and man-made disturbances. Modeling them on a large scale is challenging because behaviors vary discontinuously both spatially and in time. Modeling requires calibration and validation data that represent a diversity of causes and effects. Measured variables are either categorical (static) or dynamic (time series). Integrating multiple data types and reducing large numbers of variables to a select set often leads to subjective decision-making that has significant ramifications when applying state-of-the-art multi-step modeling approaches, e.g., land-use models driving finite element flow models. This paper is Part 1 of a two-part treatment that describes an alternative approach that employs a sequence of numerically optimized data mining algorithms. They include 1) signal decomposition to separate static, chaotic and periodic time series components that are attributable to different forcing functions; 2) time series clustering to segment monitored sites by their dynamic behaviors; 3) non-linear, multivariate sensitivity analysis using multi-layer perceptron artificial neural networks ({ANN}) to determine the relative importance of categorical variables at predicting site-to-site behavioral variability; 4) spatially interpolating dynamic behaviors with {ANNs}; and 5) assembling an end-user application that integrates data, site attribute classifiers, and prediction models to model an expansive, behaviorally heterogeneous natural system. This paper also describes applications of this approach that predict water levels and stream temperatures.},

	abstract = {Variability in sediment hydraulic properties associated with landscape depositional and erosional features can influence groundwater recharge processes by affecting soil-water storage and transmission. This study considers recharge to aquifers underlying river-incised glaciated terrain where the distribution of clay-rich till is largely intact in upland locations but has been removed by alluvial erosion in stream valleys. In a stream-dissected glacial region in eastern Nebraska (Great Plains region of the United States), recharge estimates were developed for nested profile, aquifer, and regional scales using unsaturated zone profile measurements (matric potentials, Cl− and 3H), groundwater tracers ({CFC}-12 and {SF}6), and a remote sensing-assisted water balance model. Results show a consistent influence of till lithology on recharge rates across nested spatial scales despite substantial uncertainty in all recharge estimation methods, suggesting that minimal diffuse recharge occurs through upland glacial till lithology whereas diffuse recharge occurs in river valleys where till is locally absent. Diffuse recharge is estimated to account for a maximum of 61\% of total recharge based on comparison of diffuse recharge estimated from the unsaturated zone (0–43 mm yr−1) and total recharge estimated from groundwater tracers (median 58 mm yr−1) and water balance modeling (median 56 mm yr−1). The results underscore the importance of lithologic controls on the distributions of both recharge rates and mechanisms.},

The decline could cause serious damage to the watershed. To evaluate possible changes in conditions in the Hilo area since the decline began, stream flow, water quality, and precipitation data from 1929 to 1980 were collected and analyzed. The limited data available do not indicate that the ohia decline has resulted in a significant change in either annual stream flow or peak stream flow of a stream discharging from the ohia forest in the Hilo area. Suspended sediment production of two streams remains well within accepted levels as does the chemical makeup of components dissolved in the streams.},

This investigation evaluates the accuracy and consistency of the method using rainfall-runoff series from 10 small forested-mountainous watersheds in the eastern United States, eight annual maximum series from New Hampshire, West Virginia, and North Carolina, and two partial duration series from Georgia. These series are the basis to compare tabulated curve numbers with values estimated using five methods. For nine of 10 watersheds, tabulated curve numbers do not accurately estimate runoff. One source of the large uncertainty is a consistent decrease in storm-event curve numbers with increasing rainfall. A calibrated constant curve number is suitable for only two of 10 watersheds; the others require a variable watershed curve number associated with different magnitude rainfalls or probabilities of occurrence. Paired watersheds provide consistent curve numbers, indicating that regional values for forested-mountainous watersheds (locally calibrated and adjusted for storm frequency) may be feasible.},

The intent of this study was to increase the versatility of {SWAT} by developing the capability to simulate hydrology of a non-agricultural mountainous region with a large snowmelt component. A western Wyoming basin, representative of Rocky Mountain basins, was selected to evaluate model performance, identify governing hydrologic processes, and improve the snowmelt routine. An initial evaluation of {SWAT} performance indicated an inability of the model to represent snowmelt processes. Based on simulation results and field observations, algorithms were developed which use elevation bands to distribute temperature and precipitation with elevation. Additional routines which control snowpack temperature, meltwater production, and areal snow coverage were designed to simulate the influence of season and elevation on the evolution of basin snowpack. The development of the new snowmelt algorithms improved the average annual Nash-Sutcliffe R2 correlation between simulated and observed Wind River streamflow from an initial value of -0.70 to +0.86.},

	doi = {10.1016/0022-1694(83)90177-4},
	abstract = {Reliable estimates of areal evapotranspiration are essential to significant improvements in the science and practice of hydrology. Direct measurements, such as those provided by lysimeters, eddy flux instrumentation or Bowen-ratio instrumentation, give point values, require constant attendance by skilled personnel and are based on unverified assumptions. A critical review of the methods used for estimating areal evapotranspiration indicates that the conventional conceptual techniques, such as those used in current watershed models, are based on assumptions that are completely divorced from reality; and that causal techniques based on processes and interactions in the soil-plant-atmosphere system are not likely to prove useful for another generation. However, the complementary relationship can do much to fill the gap until such time as causal techniques become practicable because it provides the basis for models that permit areal evapotranspiration to be estimated from its effects on the routine climatological observations needed to estimate potential evapotranspiration. Such models have a realistic conceptual and empirical basis, by-pass the complexity of the soil-plant system and require no local calibration of coefficients. Therefore, they are falsifiable (i.e. can be tested rigorously) so that errors in the associated assumptions and relationships can be detected and corrected by progressive testing over an ever-widening range of environments. Such a methodology uses the entire world as a laboratory and requires that a correction made to obtain agreement between model and river-basin water budget estimates in one environment must be applicable without modification in all other environment. The most recent version of the complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration ({CRAE}) models is formulated and documented. The reliability of the independent operational estimates of areal evapotranspiration is tested with comparable long-term water-budget estimates for 143 river basins in North America, Africa, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. The practicality and potential impact of such estimates are demonstrated with examples which show how the availability of such estimates can revitalize the science and practice of hydrology by providing a reliable basis for detailed water-balance studies; for further research on the development of causal models; for hydrological, agricultural and fire hazard forecasts; for detecting the development of errors in hydrometeorological records; for detecting and monitoring the effects of land-use changes; for explaining hydrologic anomalies; and for other better known applications. It is suggested that the collection of the required climatological data by hydrometric agencies could be justified on the grounds that the agencies would gain a technique for quality control and the users would gain by a significant expansion in the information content of the hydrometric data, all at minimal additional expense.},

	abstract = {Monthly evapotranspiration ({ET}) rates (2000 to 2009) across Nebraska at about 1-km resolution were obtained by linear transformations of the {MODIS} ({MODerate} resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) daytime surface temperature values with the help of the Priestley–Taylor equation and the complementary relationship of evaporation. For positive values of the mean annual precipitation and {ET} differences, the mean annual net recharge was found by an additional multiplication of the power-function-transformed groundwater vulnerability {DRASTIC}-code values. Statewide mean annual net recharge became about 29 mm (i.e., 5\% of mean annual precipitation) with the largest recharge rates (in excess of 100 mm/year) found in the eastern Sand Hills and eastern Nebraska. Areas with the largest negative net recharge rates caused by declining groundwater levels due to large-scale irrigation are found in the south-western region of the state. Error bounds of the estimated values are within 10\% to 15\% of the corresponding precipitation rates and the estimated net recharge rates are sensitive to errors in the precipitation and {ET} values. This study largely confirms earlier base-flow analysis-based statewide groundwater recharge estimates when considerations are made for differences in the recharge definitions. The current approach not only provides better spatial resolution than available earlier studies for the region but also quantifies negative net recharge rates that become especially important in numerical modeling of shallow groundwater systems.},

	abstract = {The Beale Ratio Estimator is used to estimate mean daily loads of a water quality constituent. Required input includes a year identification code, the days of the year of interest, the mean daily flow for each of these days, and the concentrations on the days on which chemical samples were taken. The mean daily load is calculated for the days of the year for which chemical observations are available, adjusted for differences in average flow between the days on which chemical observations were made and the year as a whole, and corrected for bias which results from the correlation between flow and load. The output includes both an average daily load and a confidence interval for that load. Annual loads and their confidence intervals are obtained merely by multiplying these results by 365 (or 366 in leap years). Data for multiple calculations (i.e. different parameters) can be contained in the same data file, see later for details.},

	abstract = {In this article we use moving averages to develop new classes of models in a flexible modeling framework for stream networks. Streams and rivers are among our most important resources, yet models with autocorrelated errors for spatially continuous stream networks have been described only recently. We develop models based on stream distance rather than on Euclidean distance. Spatial autocovariance models developed for Euclidean distance may not be valid when using stream distance. We begin by describing a stream topology. We then use moving averages to build several classes of valid models for streams. Various models are derived depending on whether the moving average has a “tail-up” stream, a “tail-down” stream, or a “two-tail” construction. These models also can account for the volume and direction of flowing water. The data for this article come from the Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program in Southeast Queensland, Australia, an important national program aimed at monitoring water quality. We model two water chemistry variables, {pH} and conductivity, for sample sizes close to 100. We estimate fixed effects and make spatial predictions. One interesting aspect of stream networks is the possible dichotomy of autocorrelation between flow-connected and flow-unconnected locations. For this reason, it is important to have a flexible modeling framework, which we achieve on the example data using a variance component approach.},

	abstract = {Two soil–water balance models were tested by a comparison of simulated with measured daily rates of actual evapotranspiration, soil water storage, groundwater recharge, and capillary rise. These rates were obtained from twelve weighable lysimeters with three different soils and two different lower boundary conditions for the time period from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 1998. In that period, grass vegetation was grown on all lysimeters. These lysimeters are located in Berlin-Dahlem, Germany. One model calculated the soil water balance using the Richards equation. The other one used a capacitance approach. Both models used the same modified Penman formula for the estimation of potential evapotranspiration and the same simple empirical vegetation model for the calculation of transpiration, interception, and evaporation. The comparisons of simulated with measured model outputs were analyzed using the modeling-efficiency index {IA} and the root mean squared error {RMSE}. At some lysimeters, the uncalibrated application of both models led to an underestimation of cumulative and annual rates of groundwater recharge and capillary rise, despite a good simulation quality in terms of {IA} and {RMSE}. A calibration of soil-hydraulic and vegetation parameters such as maximum rooting depth resulted in a better fit between simulated and observed cumulative and annual rates of groundwater recharge and capillary rise, but in some cases also decreased the simulation quality of both models in terms of {IA} and {RMSE}. The results of this calibration indicated that, in addition to a precise determination of the soil water-retention functions, vegetation parameters such as rooting depth should also be observed. Without such information, the rooting depth is a calibration parameter. However, in some cases, the uncalibrated application of both models also led to an acceptable fit between measured and simulated model outputs.},

	shorttitle = {Application of two hydrologic models with different runoff mechanisms to a hillslope dominated watershed in the northeastern {US}},
	abstract = {Differences in the simulation of hydrologic processes by watershed models directly affect the accuracy of results. Surface runoff generation can be simulated as either: (1) infiltration-excess (or Hortonian) overland flow, or (2) saturation-excess overland flow. This study compared the Hydrological Simulation Program—{FORTRAN} ({HSPF}) and the Soil Moisture Routing ({SMR}) models, each representing one of these mechanisms. These two models were applied to a 102 km2 watershed in the upper part of the Irondequoit Creek basin in central New York State over a seven-year simulation period. The models differed in both the complexity of simulating snowmelt and baseflow processes as well as the detail in which the geographic information was preserved by each model.

Despite their differences in structure and representation of hydrologic processes, the two models simulated streamflow with almost equal accuracy. Since streamflow is an integral response and depends mainly on the watershed water balance, this was not unexpected. Model efficiency values for the seven-year simulation period were 0.67 and 0.65 for {SMR} and {HSPF}, respectively. {HSPF} simulated winter streamflow slightly better than {SMR} as a result of its complex snowmelt routine, whereas {SMR} simulated summer flows better than {HSPF} as a result of its runoff and baseflow processes.

An important difference between model results was the ability to predict the spatial distribution of soil moisture content. {HSPF} aggregates soil moisture content, which is generally related to a specific pervious land unit across the entire watershed, whereas {SMR} predictions of moisture content distribution are geographically specific and matched field observations reasonably well. Important is that the saturated area was predicted well by {SMR} and confirmed the validity of using saturation-excess mechanisms for this hillslope dominated watershed.},

The crops studied were: maize (Zea mays L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Differences in apparent rooting depths among species and cultivars, ranging from 130 to 290 cm, were found. The comparison of the extraction front velocity ({EFV}) revealed differences among species but not among cultivars of the same species. {EFV} ranged from 44 mm day-1 for sunflower to 23 mm day-1 for peanut. In all the crops, the downward progress of the extraction front stopped at the beginning of the grain filling. Comparisons among the pooled rates of water extraction (kl) for depths from 10 to 110 cm, revealed significant differences among crops and cultivars within crops. The kl values ranged from 0.110 day-1 for Contiflor 3 sunflower to 0.029 day-1 for alfalfa. No significant correlation between kl values and root length density over 40 to 120 cm depths was found for soybean, indicating that the specific water uptake rate varies considerably in the soil profile.},

	abstract = {An artificial neural network ({ANN}) was used to evaluate the hydrological responses of two streams in the northeastern U.S. having different hydroclimatologies (rainfall and snow + rain) to hypothetical changes in precipitation and thermal regimes associated with climate change. For each stream, historic precipitation and temperature data were used as input to an {ANN}, which generated a synthetic daily hydrograph with high goodness-of-fit \$(r{\textasciicircum}2 {\textgreater} 0.80)\$ . Four scenarios of climate change were used to evaluate stream responses to climate change: + 25\% precipitation, -25\% precipitation, 2 × the coefficient of variation in precipitation regime, and +3circC average temperature. Responses were expressed in hydrological terms of ecological relevance, including flow variabilitiy, baseflow conditions, and frequency and predictability of floods. Increased average precipitation induced elevated runoff and more frequent high flow events, while decreased precipitation had the opposite effect. Elevated temperature reduced average runoff. Doubled precipitation variability had a large effect on many variables, including average runoff, variability of flow, flooding frequency, and baseflow stability. In general, the rainfall-dominated stream exhibited greater relative response to climate change scenarios than did the snowmelt stream.},

Here we demonstrate that the decrease in autumn Arctic sea ice area is linked to changes in the winter Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation that have some resemblance to the negative phase of the winter Arctic oscillation. However, the atmospheric circulation change linked to the reduction of sea ice shows much broader meridional meanders in midlatitudes and clearly different interannual variability than the classical Arctic oscillation. This circulation change results in more frequent episodes of blocking patterns that lead to increased cold surges over large parts of northern continents. Moreover, the increase in atmospheric water vapor content in the Arctic region during late autumn and winter driven locally by the reduction of sea ice provides enhanced moisture sources, supporting increased heavy snowfall in Europe during early winter and the northeastern and midwestern United States during winter. We conclude that the recent decline of Arctic sea ice has played a critical role in recent cold and snowy winters.},

In order to preserve a lake-at-rest and the positivity of water depths in drying/wetting zones, the hydrostatic reconstruction proposed by Audusse et al. [1] is implemented on cut cell grids. In addition, the gradient construction method on cut cells proposed by Causon et al. [8] is modified due to the spurious calculation when a solid boundary is nearly parallel to grids. The numerical schemes mentioned above are employed in Gerris which is open source free software and provides a shallow water solver on adaptive quadtree grids. The applied numerical schemes are validated using four test simulations: still water in an inclined domain; oscillation in a parabolic container; shock reflection by a circular cylinder; flash flood experiment in a model city. The simulation results are compared with analytical solutions, experiment data and the results simulated by other researchers.},

A simple, causal, spatially distributed soil water balance model for estimating direct groundwater recharge is described.

The study estimates the response of mean annual groundwater recharge to land cover changes which took place between 1990 and 1997. It is concluded that, in this case, the change in land cover significantly alters the pattern of recharge but, by coincidence, that the total for the catchment is unchanged.},

The most appropriate way to represent recharge in a groundwater model depends upon both physical factors and study objectives. Where the water table is close to the land surface, as in humid climates or regions with low topographic relief, a constant-head boundary condition is used. Conversely, where the water table is relatively deep, as in drier climates or regions with high relief, a specified-flux boundary condition is used. In most modeling applications, mixed-type conditions are more effective, or a combination of the different types can be used. The relative distribution of recharge can be estimated from water-level data only, but flux observations must be incorporated in order to estimate rates of recharge. Flux measurements are based on either Darcian velocities (e.g., stream baseflow) or seepage velocities (e.g., groundwater age). In order to estimate the effective porosity independently, both types of flux measurements must be available. Recharge is often estimated more efficiently when automated inverse techniques are used. Other important applications are the delineation of areas contributing recharge to wells and the estimation of paleorecharge rates using carbon-14.},

	volume = {124},
	abstract = {A relatively simple and practical approach for calculating groundwater recharge in semiarid plain environments with a relatively shallow water table, such as the Kansas Prairies, has been developed. Major uncertainties in the Darcian, water balance, and groundwater fluctuation analysis approaches were examined, and a combination methodology for reducing some of the uncertainties is proposed. By combining a storm-based soil water balance (lasting several days) with the resulting water table rise, effective storativity values of the region near the water table are obtained. This combination method is termed the 'hybrid water-fluctuation method.' Using a simple average of several such estimates results in a site-calibrated effective storativity value that can be used to translate each major water table rise tied to a specific storm period into a corresponding amount of groundwater recharge. Estimation errors in the hybrid water-fluctuation method are reduced by running a 'storm period '-based soil water balance throughout the year in combination with the associated water level rise, and by employing the {CRAE} methodology for areal evapotranspiration estimates, thus avoiding the soil-plant system complexities. Examples of soil water balance and water level fluctuation analyses based on field-measured data from Kansas show that the proposed methodology gives better and more reliable results than either of the two well-established approaches used singly.

Sultana) grapevines (Vitis vinifera) on own roots or on Ramsey rootstock (Vitis champim) was studied in irrigated vineyards. Root samples were collected using an auger at 30-, 90-, and 120-cm positions from vine trunks and perpendicular to the vine row. At each position, roots were collected at 20-cm depth intervals down the soil profile and the total length of roots measured in each sample. The root length data was used to calculate the root density (mm/cm3) in each 20-cm depth interval of the soil profile. The soil in the root zone was characterized by measuring the silt + clay content and bulk density. The soil texture in sampled vineyards was either coarse, moderately coarse, or fine. Rooting depths were 220 cm in coarse soil, 100 to 120 cm in moderately coarse soil, and 60 to 120 cm in fine soil. In coarse soil, roots were well spread throughout the soil profile, whereas roots were concentrated in the top 40 to 60 cm in both moderately coarse and fine soil. Maximum root densities measured were 0.4 mm/cm3 in coarse soil, 0.8 to 1 mm/cm3 in moderately coarse soil, and 0.7 to 1.7 mm/cm3 in fine soil. The lateral spread of roots in the traffic row was not dependent on soil texture. Further, in most vineyards sampled, the vines did not show a marked reduction in root growth in the traffic row. Ramsey rootstock vines showed more extensive root growth than own-rooted Thompson Seedless vines, particularly in the deeper layers of the soil.},

	abstract = {Summary
Climate change will change availability, quality and allocation of regional water resources. Appropriate modelling tools should therefore be available to realistically describe reactions of watersheds to climate change and to identify efficient and effective adaptation strategies on the regional scale. The paper presents the hydrologic model {PROMET} (Processes of Radiation, Mass and Energy Transfer), which was developed within the {GLOWA}-Danube project as part of the decision support system {DANUBIA}. {PROMET} covers the coupled water and energy fluxes of large-scale (A ∼ 100,000 km2) watersheds. It is fully spatially distributed, raster-based with raster-elements of 1 km2 area, runs on an hourly time step, strictly conserves mass and energy and is not calibrated using measured discharges. Details on the model concept and the individual model components are given.

An application case of {PROMET} is given for the mountainous Upper-Danube watershed in Central Europe (A = 77,000 km2). The water resources are intensively utilized for hydropower, agriculture, industry and tourism. The water flows are significantly influenced by man-made structures like reservoirs and water diversions. A 33-years model run covering the period from 1971 to 2003 using the existing meteorological station network as input is used to validate the performance of {PROMET} against measured stream flow data. Three aspects of the model performance were validated with good to very good results: the annual variation of the water balance of the whole watershed and selected sub-watersheds, the daily runoff for the whole period at selected gauges and the annual flood peaks and low flows (minimum 7-days average).

{PROMET} is used to investigate the impact of climate change on the water cycle of the Upper Danube. A stochastic climate generator is fed with two scenarios of climate development until 2060. One assumes no future temperature change, the other uses the temperature trends of the {IPCC}-A1B climate change scenario. {PROMET} is run with both climate data sets. No change in low-flow is detected when no temperature change is assumed. The {IPCC}-A1B climate scenario results in marked decreases of low-flow at the outlet of the watershed.},

	abstract = {The effect of non-native trees on hydrological processes in Hawaiian forests remains largely unquantified. In this study, throughfall was determined by stationary methods over 18–23-month study periods at three locations each dominated by one of three non-native tree species including Schinus terebinthifolius, Coffea arabica, and Psidium cattleianum. The lowest mean throughfall percentage of 44\% occurred under a monotypic stand of P. cattleianum. Mean throughfall under canopies dominated by C. arabica and S. terebinthifolius were 59 and 60\%, respectively. Annualized throughfall rates were computed as 62, 60, and 45\% under canopies dominated by S. terebinthifolius, C. arabica, and P. cattleianum, respectively. The low mean throughfall at each location is likely due to high wet-canopy evaporation combined with frequent low-intensity/low magnitude rainfall. The exceptionally low throughfall under P. cattleianum may be the result of larger amounts of intercepted rainfall being diverted to stemflow and/or trunk storage. Observations suggest that stemflow is a substantial component of the canopy water balance in stands of P. cattleianum. Plant area index ({PAI}) was the lowest (3.66) under P. cattleianum and highest (4.64) under C. arabica. Mean direct throughfall coefficient p was computed from individual storm events at each location and ranged from a low of 0.16 under the canopy dominated by P. cattleianum to a high of 0.31 under the canopy dominated by S. terebinthifolius. A similarly computed mean canopy storage capacity S varied from 2.5 mm under primarily S. terebinthifolius to 4.0 mm at the location dominated by C. arabica.},

Although these expansions do not converge near the branch point of the W function (corresponds to Green–Ampt infiltration with immediate ponding), a method is presented for approximating W−1 that is exact at the branch point and asymptotically, with interpolation between these limits. Some existing and several new simple and compact yet robust approximations applicable to Green–Ampt infiltration and flux are presented, the most accurate of which has a maximum relative error of 5\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;10−5\%.

	shorttitle = {A single layer soil water balance model for estimating deep drainage (potential recharge)},
	abstract = {The understanding and quantification of groundwater recharge in semi-arid areas are fundamental to sound management of water resources in such areas. A soil water balance model, if designed to adequately represent the physical processes involved, and if carried out with a short enough (daily) time step, can provide realistic estimates of deep drainage (potential recharge) over long periods.

We describe a single store (single layer) mass water balance model applicable to semi-arid areas, which recognises the wetting of the near surface during rainfall, with subsequent availability of water for evaporation and transpiration in the days following rainfall. The model allows for the major hydrological processes taking place at or near the soil-vegetation surface including runoff.

Model results are presented for North-east Nigeria, for a continuous period of 36 years during which mean annual rainfall was 431 mm (range 321–650 mm) and mean annual modelled deep drainage was 14 mm (range 0–95 mm, with 23 years having zero potential recharge). The modelling results indicate that annual rainfall totals are not the main predictor of annual recharge. The temporal distribution of daily rainfall and the magnitude of the antecedent (pre-season) soil moisture deficit are the strongest determinants of deep drainage at a particular location, in a particular year. Sensitivity analysis of soil and vegetation parameters suggests that deep drainage is most sensitive to water holding capacity and rooting depth. These are key parameters which determine spatial variability of potential recharge.

The model is shown to be plausible by examination of the concepts which underlie it, by comparison with field soil moisture measurements, and by the model's ability to represent qualitative observations of crop yield variations from year to year.

Future development of the model could include applications to other climatic conditions and the inclusion of other hydrologic processes.},

	abstract = {There is a deep disconnect between scientific and public concern about climate change. One reason is that global climate change is a fairly abstract concept with little perceived relevance, so a key challenge is to translate climate-change projections into locally concrete examples of potential impacts. Here we use climate analog analyses as an alternative method for identifying and communicating climate-change impacts. Our analysis uses multiple downscaled general circulation models for the state of Wisconsin, at 0.1 decimal degree resolution, and identifies contemporary locations in North America that are the most similar to the projected future climates for Wisconsin. We assess the uncertainties inherent in climate-change projections among greenhouse gas emission scenarios, time windows (mid-21st century vs. late 21st-century) and different combinations of climate variables. For all future scenarios and simulations, contemporary climatic analogs within North America were found for Wisconsin’s future climate. Closest analogs are primarily 200–500 km to the south-southwest of their Wisconsin reference location. Temperature has the largest effect on choice of climatic analog, but precipitation is the greatest source of uncertainty. Under the higher-end emission scenarios, the contemporary climatic analogs for Wisconsin’s end-21st-century climates are almost entirely outside the state. Climate-analog analyses offer a place-based means of assessing climate impacts that is complementary to the species-based approaches of species distributional models, and carries no assumptions about the characterization and conservatism of species niches. The analog method is simple and flexible, and can be readily extended to other regions and other environmental variables.},

	abstract = {Applications of grid-based systems are widespread in many areas of environmental analysis. In this study, the concept is adapted to the modeling of water temperature by integrating a macroscale hydrologic model, variable infiltration capacity ({VIC}), with a computationally efficient and accurate water temperature model. The hydrologic model has been applied to many river basins at scales from 0.0625° to 1.0°. The water temperature model, which uses a semi-Lagrangian numerical scheme to solve the one-dimensional, time-dependent equations for thermal energy balance in advective river systems, has been applied and tested on segmented river systems in the Pacific Northwest. The state-space structure of the water temperature model described in previous work is extended to include propagation of uncertainty. Model results focus on proof of concept by comparing statistics from a study of a test basin with results from other studies that have used either process models or statistical models to estimate water temperature. The results from this study compared favorably with those of selected case studies using data-driven statistical models. The results for deterministic process models of water temperature were generally better than the grid-based method, particularly for those models developed from site-specific, data-intensive studies. Biases in the results from the grid-based system are attributed to heterogeneity in hydraulic characteristics and the method of estimating headwater temperatures.},
