## Curve Number Aligner

One of the developers of curve number methodology developed a graphical method whereby curve numbers for soil hydrologic group A, C, and D may be estimated from the curve number assigned to soil hydrologic group B. Use of the curve number aligner is encouraged as it will maintain reasonable differences in curve number value between the various soil hydrologic groups for a given landuse.

The curve number aligner has been expressed in equation form as given below [@woodward_runoff_2003]:

$CN_A = -60.8  +  1.6083 CN_B$

$CN_B =  CN_B$

$CN_C =  34.0  +  0.6600 CN_B$

$CN_D =  47.2  +  0.5283 CN_B$
